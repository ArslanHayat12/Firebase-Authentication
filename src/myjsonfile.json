      "description": "Attabad Lake (عطا آباد جھیل) is a lake in Gojal Valley, Hunza, Gilgit Baltistan, an administrative region of Pakistan. The lake was created in January 2010 as a result of the Attabad Disaster. Attabad Lake has become one of the biggest tourist attractions in Gilgit-Baltistan offering activities like boating, jet skiing, fishing and other recreational activities.\n\nThe lake was formed due to a massive landslide at Attabad Village in Hunza Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan, 9 mi upstream (east) of Karimabad that occurred on 4 January 2010. The landslide killed twenty people and blocked the flow of the Hunza River for five months. The lake flooding has displaced 6,000 people from upstream villages, stranded (from land transportation routes) a further 25,000, and inundated over 12 mi of the Karakoram Highway. The lake reached 13 mi long and over 100 m in depth by the first week of June 2010 when it began flowing over the landslide dam, completely submerging lower Shishkat and partly flooding Gulmit. The subdivision of Gojal has the greatest number of flooded buildings, over 170 houses, and 120 shops. The residents also had shortages of food and other items due to the blockage of the Karakoram Highway. By 4 June water outflow from the lake had increased to 3700 cuft/s.\n\nWater levels continued to rise in 18 June 2010 caused by a difference in the outflow and inflow of the new lake. As bad weather continued, the supply of food, medicine and other goods was stopped as all forms of transportation including helicopter service to Hunza could not resume.\n\nVictims of the landslide and expansion of the lake staged a sit-in protesting the lack of government action and compensation payments to them.\n\nAs a result of the damming of Hunza River, five villages north of the barrier were flooded. One village, Ayeenabad, was completely submerged. Major portions of another village, Shishkat, was also submerged. Around 40% of the village of Gulmit, which also serves as the headquarters of Gojal Valley, was also submerged. Significant portions of land in Hussaini and Ghulkin villages of Gojal also got submerged as a result of the surging lake.\n\nThe entire population of Hunza and Gojal valley, up to 25,000 individuals, were affected as a result of the lake, due to difficulties of road access and reaching business markets and loss of land, houses, and agricultural products.\n\nAttabad Lake has been visited by former Prime Ministers Yousuf Raza Gillani and Nawaz Sharif, and by the Chief Minister of Punjab Shahbaz Sharif, Sharif announced Rs 100 million of aid for the victims from the Punjab government and Rs 0.5 million for the relatives of those who died in the landslide.\n\nAreas downstream from the lake remained on alert despite some officials believing that a major flood scenario was less likely as the river began flowing over the landslide dam during the first week of June 2010. Many people have been evacuated to 195 relief camps. Two hospitals downstream, the Kashrote Eye Vision Hospital and the Aga Khan Health Service, evacuated both their staff and equipment. Some officials had incorrectly predicted that as soon as the lake began flowing over the landslide dam, an 60 ft wave would hit the areas immediately downstream.\n\nAs of 14 June 2010, the water level continued to rise. DawnNews reported that \"242 houses, 135 shops, four hotels, two schools, four factories, and several hundred acres of agricultural land\" had been flooded, and that villagers were receiving food and school fee subsidies. They reported that 25 km of the Karakoram Highway and six bridges were destroyed.\n\nFrontier Works Organization blasted the spillway of the lake first on 27 March 2012 and then on 15 May 2012, lowering the lake's water level by at least 33 ft.\n\nPart of Karakorum Highway was submerged due to this landslide. On 14 September 2015, Prime Minister of Pakistan performed inauguration of realigned patch of KKH containing five tunnels at Attabad Barrier Lake. The five tunnels, together 7 km long, are part of the long portion of the Karakorum Highway (KKH) which was damaged in 2010 due to land sliding at Attabad. The realignment project is a construction masterpiece completed at the cost of $275 million. The realignment restored the road link between Pakistan and China and it is expected that significant amount of trade will be conducted between China and Pakistan using it. The KKH is also a part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and is expected to significantly increase economic integration between those two nations.\n\n\n * Tangjiashan Lake, also formed by a landslide\n * Sarez Lake, a large lake formed by a landslide\n * Red Lake, a mountain lake formed by a landslide\n * 2010 Pakistan floods\n\n\n\n* Landslide Lake on Hunza River Overflows into Spillway – Earth Observatory (NASA)",

The altitude of Borith is roughly 2600 m above sea level.\n\nIt lies approximately 2 km to the north of Ghulkin, a saline body of water occupying a small hollow at an elevation of 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). The lake can be reached via a 2 km unpaved jeep route from Husseini village, which lies adjacent to Ghulkin village. It is also accessible by a 2-3 hour trekking route directly from Ghuylkin, across the end of the Ghulkin glacier. The site is a sanctuary for migrating wildfowl and is often visited by bird-watchers and nature lovers. To witness the large number of ducks arriving from the warmer parts of southern Pakistan, one should visit between the months of March and June. The birds rest here on their way northwards to the cooler waters of central Asia. Similarly, from September&ndash;November, the event occurs in reverse with the onset of winter towards the north.\n\nA short trek of one hour each way brings visitors to Ghulkin Glacier. Hikers can follow the trekking route towards Borith Lake as far as the edge of the glacier, and return by the same route.\n\nA longer walk to Passu Gar Glacier is another attraction, crossing both Ghulkin Glacier and Borith Lake. Having crossed Ghulkin Glacier by the same route, hikers can continue on the southern side of Borith Lake past the settlement of Borith Bala and the now deserted settlement of Shahabad. The lack of a continuous water supply led to the desertification of this village many years ago. The walk takes about 4&ndash;5 hours form Ghulkin to Passu. From the glacier, a path leads down to the Karakorum Highway and the Shisper Hotel.\n\n\n * Attabad Lake\n * Hunza Valley\n\n\n * Gulkin Glacier and Borith Lake info\n * Northern Pakistan detailed placemarks in Google Earth",

It is surrounded by mountains.\n\nHanna Lake is in the hills close to where the Urak Valley begins 17 km east from Quetta city. The reservoir was constructed in 1894 during the British Colonial era on the land of local tribesmen, and is one of the main attractions in the city and a great historical bridge wall between two mountains the depths like battlements of a fort for storing of water.\n\nThere is a lakeside restaurant with picnic tables shaded by pine trees at the end of the river where families can enjoy the food and weather on the eastern part the Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy (HDWSA) the first and only rowing, canoeing, kayaking and sailing training and championships organising centre in Balochistan Province with provision of rough swimming facility. Hanna Lake is one of the most visited and accessible lakes in Balochistan.\n\nIn 1894, the small action dam Surrpull (Red Bridge) was constructed on main Urak road to control flood and divert water catastrophically into Hanna Lake coming from the Zarghoon Ghar and Murddar Mountains Koh-i-Murdaar streams, snow melting and rains through its main canal.\n\nOver a century old in 1908, this lake was spread over an area of 818 acres with a holding capacity of over 220 million gallons of water and a depth of 49 ft.In 1973 a heavy flood destroyed the Murdar Mountains recharge linked canal on the way to Surrpull near Spin Kaarrez road which has not been (Restored) reconstructed till date.\n\nPresently on May 2016 the heavy flood filled this small action dam Surrpull with mud and stones resultantly all the streams and floods water are going waste and there is no chance to regulate water conservancy to Hanna lake without the restoration, Desilting of surrpull and both main canals on the other hand the water level in Hanna Lake is going deadly low hence the natural ecosystem wild life, environment of the surrounding, natives along with hundreds of migrated birds and thousands of fish followed by the future of the athletes of rowing and canoeing are in danger and on conclusion the Hanna Lake will be fully dried like in 1999 to January 2005 and in 2010.\n\nThe environmental scientists, Speleologists and the Conservationist are looking the future of the lake in most dangerous condition and the current harmful environment situations will badly affect the natural eco system, environment, underground water level of the surroundings, however the small action dam surpull was locally restored / desilted in February 2019 with the assistance of Hashim Khan Ghalzai secretary P&D and Hayatullah Khan Durrani C.E HDWSA and since the rain flood from Zarghoon mountains are continuesly coming to Hanna Lake and the water level has been raised up to 50%.\n\nOn 22 July 1986, Haji Khair Muhammad Khan Kakar Son of Sarfaraz Khan Kakar gifted 2 Acre (8093.71 square meter)of land on the North West edge of Hanna Lake to Hayatullah Khan Durrani known for caving and Mountaineering Adventure sports in Balochistan.

There is also a water channel which was constructed at the same time by the British to convert the snow and rain water near Spin Kaarez, coming from Murdar Mount, as surplus for filling the water in this lake. The channel was destroyed by a heavy flood in 1976 and has still not been re-constructed. The loss of the snow and rain water was wasted causing Hanna Lake to fully dry up between 1999 and January 2005. The government of Balochistan did nothing for the restoration of water level at Hanna lake but the Hanna Lake Development Authority (HLDA) the custodians of Hanna Lake and HDWSA officials had full efforts for the restoration of arrival of water through the surplus canal to Hanna Lake.\n\nFrom years 2000–2010 Hanna Lake dried up and the natives along with hundreds of migrated birds were in trouble.\n\nHowever, in 2011 the lake re-filled and once again gave rise to flora and fauna in its environment. The turquoise waters of the lake provide a rich contrast to the sandy brown of the hills in the background. One can promenade on the terraces or hire a boat and paddle on the lake and round the island in the middle.\n\n\n * Hanna-Urak Waterfall\n * Quetta\n * Urak Valley\n\n\n * Quetta-city.blogspot: Hanna Lake\n * Flickr: Hanna Lake and Mountains",

The lake is a source of the Kunhar river. At an elevation of 3,224 m (10,578 feet) above sea level, the lake is located above the tree line, and is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan.\n\nSaiful Muluk is located in the Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, about 9 km north of Naran, in the northern part of Kaghan Valley. Malika Parbat, the highest peak in the valley is near the lake.\n\nThe lake is accessible from the nearby town of Naran during the summer season but access during winter is limited.\n\nSaiful Muluk was formed by glacial moraines that blocked the water of the stream passing through the valley. The Kaghan Valley was formed in the greater Pleistocene Period dating back almost 300,000 years when the area was covered with ice. Rising temperatures and receding glaciers left a large depression where glaciers once stood. Melting water collected into the lake.\n\nThe lake has rich eco-diversity and holds many species of blue-green algae. Large brown trout are found in the lake, up to about seven kilograms. About 26 species of vascular plant exist in the area, with Asteraceae the most commonly found species. Other species commonly found in the region are: Ranunculaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae, Gramineae, Apiaceae, Leguminosae, Scrophulariaceae and Polygonaceae.\n\nThe Lake Saiful Muluk is named after a legendary prince. A fairy tale called Saif-ul-Muluk, written by the Sufi poet Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, talks of the lake. It tells the story of the prince of Persia named Prince Saiful Malook who fell in love with a fairy princess named Princess Badri-ul-Jamala at the lake.\n\n\n\n\n * Lulusar Lake\n * Katora Lake\n * Dudipatsar Lake\n * Mahodand Lake\n * Ratti Gali Lake\n\n\n * About Saiful Malook Lake\n * SaifulMuluk\n * PTDC Official website\n * Kaghan Valley & Lake Saiful Muluk - Pictures\n * Full text of the fairytale associated with the lake.",

The lake is also known as Shangrila lake after a resort built on its bank in 1983.\n\nShangrila was established in 1983 with the opening of the first Resort Hotel in Skardu, Gilgit-Baltistan. Shangrila Resort Hotel was founded by the late Muhammad Aslam Khan Afridi, the first commander of the Northern Scouts of the Pakistan Army. The resort is known for its restaurant that is built on the fuselage of an aircraft that had crashed nearby.\n\nShangrila was named after a book titled Lost Horizon by James Hilton. In the novel, the author narrates a tale in which an airplane crash landed near a riverbed, in the early 1920s. The surviving passengers came across some Buddhist monks from a nearby temple and sought their help. They were taken to a beautiful lamasery filled with a variety of fruits and flowers. The monks looked quite young, although they claimed to be hundreds of years old. The idyllic place was called Shangri-la, a Tibetan word meaning \"Heaven on earth\". In 2015, one of the photo of Shangrila Resort was declared as the grand winner of the Wiki Loves Earth, 2015, after a worldwide contest.\n\n",

The resort is located in Malam Jabba village, 40 kilometers east of Saidu Sharif and 314 kilometers northwest of Islamabad. It is the largest and oldest ski resort in Pakistan.\n\nThe Wali of Swat, who at the time was the historic ruler of Swat, would move his court to Malam Jabba annually during the summer months. In the summer of 1962, the visiting Austrian ambassador to Pakistan and good friend of the Wali, suggested that a ski resort be built in Malam Jabba. The Austrian government funded the chairlift and provided skis and boots, while the Pakistani government built a hotel with 50 rooms. Construction of the entire resort finished in 1988, but the resort sat idle for another 10 years because of disputes over whether it should be run by the government or the private sector. In 1999, the government won rights to run the resort. By 2006, over 20,000 people in Swat were employed indirectly by tourism to the region, including the resort. In 2007, tourism and skiing infrastructure and businesses in Swat took a severe financial burden under Taliban occupation. The resort was converted into a stronghold for militants. In April 2009, Operation Black Thunderstorm (Rah-e-Rast) was initiated, in a bid to retake control of the valley. As the army closed in on positions on the militants, the ski lift was destroyed and the hotel at the resort was set ablaze. The army retook Swat, but years of uncertainty and mayhem had negatively impacted international skiing in Pakistan. In 2014, the Tourism Corporation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leased Malam Jabba to the Samson Group of Companies for reconstruction of the ski resort and hotel, in a bid to boost tourism in the area again. That same year the Swat Snow Festival was arranged to showcase rebuilding activities at Malam Jabba. The Norwegian embassy in Islamabad initiated the collection of skis, and Pakistani Norwegian businessman and politician Aamir Sheikh helped to collect skis, boots and gloves. Pakistan's Olympic skier Muhammad Karim, who participated in the recent Sochi Olympics, competed in the giant slalom and downhill during the event.\n\nMalam Jabba ski resort is currently partially functional.

It also hosted the 2016 Karakoram Alpine Ski Cup.\n\nNaltar is the oldest ski resort in Pakistan, however is relatively less known and less developed than Malam Jabba ski resort. The major obstacle to Naltar’s development has been the dilapidated condition of the road leading from Gilgit to Naltar. As things stand, the one-hour journey to Naltar is near impossible unless ski enthusiasts travel there by 4 wheel jeep.

      "description": "\n\nNathia Gali or Nathiagali undefined) is a mountain resort town or hill station in Abbottabad District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is located at the center of the Galyat range, where several hill-stations are situated, closely connected to each other, and with their names mostly ending in 'Gali'. Nathiagali is known for its scenic beauty, hiking tracks and pleasant weather, which is much cooler than the rest of the Galyat due to it being at a greater altitude. It is situated 32 kilometers at one hour's drive away from both Murree and Abbottabad, lying midway between these two places. The drive time from Islamabad and Peshawar is about three and four hours, respectively, unless there is a lot of traffic.\n\nDuring British rule Nathia Gali, then part of Abbottabad tehsil of Hazara District, served as the summer headquarters of the Chief Commissioner of the (then) Peshawar division of the Punjab. The town along with Dunga Gali constituted a notified area under the Punjab Municipalities Act, 1891. The income in 1903-4 was Rs. 3,000 chiefly derived from a house tax, whilst expenditure was Rs. 1,900.\n\nA British Kashmiri family were once driven up to the highest point in Nathiagali only realising at the last moment that their driver and guide had never driven in snow before. This revelation occurred at the exact moment the minibus they were travelling in began sliding on the ice towards the edge of the mountain. Nathiagali has no road safety barriers after Muree, travellers are advised not to attempt to ascend in winter months at night without a competent driver and experienced guide.\n\nThe weather of Nathiagali remains cool, pleasant and foggy in summers (1 May to 31 August). During the monsoon season (1 July to 16 September), rain is expected almost every day. Cold winds start to chill the weather in autumn. winters (1 November to 28 February) are very cold and chilly. In December and January, heavy snowfall occurs here. The weather remains cold in spring. Here most comfortable weather is the summer season. Frequent rainfall occurs here annually. Rainfall lies between 1650mm-1850mm annually.in winter temperature can drop to _10*C and in summer it rise to a high of 30*C.\n\nThe town is connected to Abbottabad and Murree by Nathiagali road. Public transport runs daily from Abbottabad and Rawalpindi to Nathiagali.\n\nBetween December to January, heavy snowfall can occur in this area and the road leading to Nathiagali is sometimes blocked due to heavy snow.\n\nNathiagali is covered by all GSM operators. Land line phone service is also available here.\n\nHotels, rest houses and cottages equipped with most facilities are available here for the tourists. From May to August their rates become high.\n\nA small market also exists here where all the basic necessities of life are available.\n\nNathia Gali town also serves as the administrative centre of Nathia Gali Union Council. It is today located in what is the Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At an elevation of 2,410 m (8,000 ft), it is a popular tourist resort in the summer months. It is forested with pine, cedar, oak walnut and also oak and maple trees.\n\nDuring the summer, Nathia Gali is relatively popular amongst tourists, but due to its limited area and availability of property, it is not thronged by as many people as the hill-station Murree, which is only an hour away, even though it has more recreation. Nathiagali is known for a beautiful trek that leads to Thandiani that passes through Dagri naka.\n\nAyubia National Park is also one of the spots here that tourists and nature lovers often visit.\n\nThe natural scenery is highly attractive. Nathia Gali is famous for its lush green meadows, deep forests of oak, cedar and pine, where fog in July/August present a glory. In winter snowfall adds to the scene. Nathia Gali has a church, St. Matthew's, a remnant from the British period and made entirely of wood. It is situated at the edge of the mountain with a nice panorama towards Kashmir. Nathia Gali has a mini bazaar. Mukshpuri and Miranjani are two nearby high peaks. On a clear day, the Nanga Parbat can be seen in the distance.\n\nThe Nathia Gali region is home to various species of birds, insects, butterflies and other animals. The World Wildlife Fund has an office in the Galliat and has assisted in the breeding and reintroduction of the species of the near-extinct common hill leopard in the forests of the Ayubia National park, right by Dungagali and Nathia Gali. This area was thought to be a perfect habitat for them but according to local reports they frequently came out of the forest after cattle of the local villagers and were occasionally shot. Packs of pi-dogs which were previously considered to be a night-time menace can no longer be seen anywhere in the Galliat; it is thought that most have been killed by leopards. In the summer of 2006, several women were found dead in the deep valleys of Galliat with wounds from attacks. A large leopard was caught and eventually shot. His body has been stuffed and kept in the Dunga Gali Wildlife Museum, where he has been named the 'Ghost of Galyat'. However, despite their reputation, these leopards are rarely spotted.\n\nHorses are a common sight during summer months and are offered to children and adults alike for rides at rates that are often negotiable. The common hill rhesus monkeys can often be seen. Previously known to be a little shy, they have reportedly become more aggressive in recent years. This may be due to increased interaction with tourists, who often tease these monkeys or try to catch them. Monkeys often come up to guesthouses and hotels in search of snacks and can be quite noisy and playful. Visitors are advised to sun their bedding on arrival to get rid of bed-bugs, and to keep repellents and pesticides for insects as these have a tendency to show up a lot, especially in old homes, and in the monsoon season.\n\nThe Union Council of Nathia Gali is divided into the following areas: Bagan, Donga Gali, Jhansa, Keri Sarafali, Keri Raiki, Lassan, Malach, Nathiagali and Pasala.\n\nThe main tribe of Nathia Gali is the Karlal tribe, and a minority of Dhunds (who now call themselves 'Dhund-Abbasis'). The locals are a kin to the people of other parts of Galyat and speak the Hindko language. Until well into the 1960s, most of these tribes and clans were mostly living rather basic and primitive lives, due to lack of educational and employment opportunities and most of them had to seek jobs and education down in the plains and cities such as Rawalpindi, Lahore, Peshawar and even as far away as Karachi; but in more recent times, with economic development, many of them are either employed locally in the tourism industry or in various jobs and businesses in the Abbottabad area. It is monitored by GDA.\n\n\n\n\n * Galyat\n * Abbottabad\n\n* FAQ about Nathiagali (Question Answers about Nathiagali)\n * Places to Visit in Abbottabad\n * Miranjani Trek by Shaikh Muhammad Ali\n * The Pipe Line Trek by Shaikh Muhammad Ali\n * Mokshpuri Trek by Shaikh Muhammad Ali\n * http://www.nathiagali.com\n * Nathiagali Pictures\n * Governor's House\n * Sarhad Tourism Corporation, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan\n * http://www.nathiagali.com/?page_id=16\n * Hotels in Nathiagali (reservation)\n * Hotel in Nathiagali (book your corporate event)\n * FAQ about Nathiagali (Question Answers about Nathiagali)",

      "title": "Shimshal",
      "description": "\n\nShimshal (شمشال) is a village located in Gojal Tehsil of Hunza District, in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan formerly known as Northern Areas of Pakistan. It lies at an altitude of 3,100 m above sea level and is the highest settlement in the district. It is in the valley of the Shimshal River, a tributary of the Hunza River. Shimshal is a border village that connects the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Pakistan with China. The total area of Shimshal is approximately 3,800 km 2 and there are around two thousand inhabitants with a total of 240 households.\n\nShimshal is made up of four major hamlets; Farmanabad, Aminabad, center Shimshal and Khizarabad. Farmanabad is a new settlement that comes first on reaching Shimshal. Aminabad is announced by vast fields of stones hemmed in by dry stone walls, and fortress-like houses of stone and mud. As you approach Shimshal look for a glimpse of Odver Sar (6,303m) also known as Shimshal Whitehorn. Shimshal has hydroelectricity from Odver stream for five months from June to October of the year (when the water isn't frozen). Non availability of electricity for seven months is a major problem of the local community because during this period they have had to rely on kerosene oil, firewood, solar plates and Compressed Natural Gas in cylinders as an alternatives. A small hydro electricity power station of 0.200MW is under construction at Kuk area of Shimshal that is scheduled to be complete in 2017.\n\nThe village was inaccessible by motor road until October 2003, when a new road from the Karakoram Highway at Passu was constructed. The construction of non-metallic Jeep-able road started in 1985 and completed in 2003. Eighteen years (1985-2003) of handwork finally became successful because of hard work, dedication and self-help. It became possible to connect Shimshal with rest of the world by mutual cooperation of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme, Government of Pakistan and the local community. It now takes maximum three hours to reach Shimshal by jeep from Passu. Self-help or Nomus (in local Wakhi language) is the major factor for infrastructure development in Shimshal.\n\nShimshalis use numerous seasonal mountain grasslands, located several days walk from the village, to sustain herds of yaks, goats, and sheep. The area was founded by Mamo Singh and his wife named Khudija.They have the only son Sher. According to Shimshal's history and tradition, their first child won the local polo game from Kargiz (Chinese) riding yak while the Chinese rode horses.The Shimshal River comes from this area and then transforms the shape of Hunza River, which joins the Indus River below the capital city Gilgit.\n\nThe people of Shimshal are Wakhi and they speak the Wakhi language. They belong to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. The entire community is the follower of Aga Khan as their 49th spiritual leader who is the direct descendant of Muhammad.\n\nShimshal has produced several well known mountaineers for Pakistan; among those Samina Baig is the first women climber from Pakistan to scale Mt.Everest and all highest peaks in seven continents around the globe. Rajab Shah has the honor of scaling all five highest peaks in Pakistan. Both Rajab Shah and Mehrban karim have received Presidential Award for Pride of Performance in the field of mountaineering. In fact Shimshalis are to Pakistan as Sherpas are to Nepal. Some people call Shimshal, The Valley of Mountaineers in Pakistan.\n\nShimshal is the largest village of Hunza valley. Its extensive pasture lands include; Shimshal Pamir, Gujerav, Yazghail and Loopghar. The Shimshal Pamir lake attracts many tourists to it.\n\nThe Lok Versa Museum of Shimshal has some antiques, artifacts, musical instruments, and daily life items made from wood and showcases the creativity and rich history of local community.\n\nTwo books by Pam Henson are about Shimshal, \"Shimshal\" and \"Women of Shimshal\" have been published by the Shimshal Trust. Henson is a teacher from New Zealand and wrote these books based on her experiences teaching and living in Shimshal.\n\nRIVER :-\n\nThe river of Shimshal if formed by 3 sources: Khurdopin Glacier, Shimshal Pass and Zardgorban. While flowing it also got some other water sources get add up in it and it gets add up in Khunjrab River to Passu River and ends up in Attabad Lake.\n\n\n\nThe village of Shimshal was founded almostly 1450 years ago by Mamu Shing, he was a person from hunza and a member of the Wazir's family, means he belonged to the prime-minister's family  He was sent to Sarikol with his wife Khodija who was also a wakhi person .He was sent there  as an ambassador, but because of some worst situations between Sarikol and hunza  he ran away from Sarikol with his wife. They were chased till the upper hunza ; they made their home for several years before migrating into  the Shimshal Valley. When they reached to shimshal  it was such a remote place that his wife got angry but later on they starting developing that area\n\nThere Mamu Singh built up his flocks of sheep and goats, and explored up the Shimshal Valley, he  discovered  a hole in the ground, whose mouth was covered with a great piece of slate. When he succeeded in removing the stone, water came out  from the hole and flowed along the remains of a channel that had been built by earlier travelers who had pass. He made a channel from which he could made a village.\n\nSooner, Khodija gave birth to a son and they named him Sher, and then they started teaching him important things  ; specially hunting\n\nWhen he grew up he did go for hunting and one day while his way for a hunt he met some strangers in the Pamir. strangers and Sher both said that the Pamir is theirs’ .So they ended up saying that the winner of the polo match that they will be playing will have  the Pamir .The bet was if Sher drove the ball over Shimshal Pass toward Shuwert, he would win all territories  from Shimshal to Raskam. after winning the area Sher started to explore it and on the other hand his family thought that he was lost somewhere in Pamir forever.\n\nAfter year he returned to shimshal and he found out that his parents were dead. After a while he founded a Wakhi women and married her and she gave some sons too him and then the generations goes on and the three main lineage groupings of Shimshal: Gazikator, Bakhtikator and Baqikator were there.\n\nThen after some time they started ruling with the hunza rulers and Mirs then countries  got independences, it is to be said that shimshal was the part of china before but Pakistani government made some deals with china and gave kashgir part of Pakistan to china and took shimshal and some territory in Pakistan and draw a boader line at shimshal pass.\n\nBut it was till under Mir and hunza kingdom until in 1974 when Zulfiqar Bhutto abolished Pakistan's last remaining princely kingdoms\n\nMIR:-\n\nMany narrators can remember life under the Mir's regime. The Mir is reported by some to have held his people back by limiting education and making it difficult for people to gain permission to travel outside Hunza. Shimshal, like other communities in Hunza, was required to provide the Mir with certain agricultural and livestock products as tax payments. In addition, because of Shimshalis' access to rock salt, Shimshal had a special salt tax. These taxes were carried by Shimshalis to Hunza. Baig Daulat provides a very detailed account of the taxes that Shimshalis paid to and carried for the Mir and how this was organised within Shimshal: \"Those who possessed livestock and more family members and those on whom God had bestowed wealth were called lopan. They were required to pay yeelban (taxes)… Those who were poor were called borwar (literally, having load; those who carried the Mir's taxes).\" However it is important to note that these positions were not fixed statuses. Someone with plenty of livestock and physically strong men in the family could choose to be borwar rather than lopan.\n\nAt the village level, certain individuals would act on behalf of the Mir in a range of positions including: arbob (the Mir's representative in the village); yarpa (responsible for the Mir's livestock); chorbu (public announcer). Several narrators suggest that the Mir accepted bribes from those in such positions or those who wanted such positions. Having a female relative who had breast-fed one of the Mir's family members could also ensure one obtaining a position: \"My uncle Momin Shah was the first yarpa of Shimshal, because his mother's sister had [breast] fed Mir Nazeem Khan's son. So on the basis of this relation my uncle got the yarpagi for the first time\".\n\nAlthough the Mir's tax system came to an end in the 1960s, Shimshalis were still not entirely free from carrying loads for others. The Pakistan army came to Shimshal in the late 1960s and was posted in Pamir because of border disputes with China. Many Shimshalis worked as porters for the army. One narrator (Pakistan 20) explains: \"we had to take their ration, ammunition from Passu to Quz (a pasture)… the government didn't pay our daily wages directly to our own hands. They had contractors… And these contractors were not honest enough to pay our wages. Sometimes they gave us a piece of cloth instead of the amount and most of the time they paid nothing.\" Today many Shimshalis work as porters for trekking and mountaineering groups and expeditions.\n\nShimshal Pass (4,735 m) rises above the village. It lies on the watershed between the Indus River and Tarim River basins, and leads to the valley of the Shimshal Braldu River, a tributary of the Shaksgam River on the border with China. Francis Younghusband was probably the first Englishman to reach the pass (1889). At the time it was used by raiders from Hunza to attack caravans traveling between Leh and Yarkand. There was a fort manned by Hunza soldiers, or raiders, or both. The pass is not part of Khunjerab National Park, but the Shimshal community has set an organization called SNT (Shimshal Nature Trust) which oversees the entire region and takes care of its own land. It is a community-based organization and is registered with the Government of Pakistan.\n\nAnnually, in the last week of July or the first week of August, there is a festival at Shimshal Pass, where locals partake in a yak race, followed by singing and dancing. In Wakhi language it is called Woolyo. This yak race is the only one of its kind, and is a unique event organised at high mountain settlements of Pakistan.\n\n* Shimshal Nature Trust is a community-based development organization. The Science and Practice of Ecology & Society Award (SPES) was granted to Shimshal Nature Trust in Pakistan.\n\nNomus is a Wakhi word commonly known in Shimshal valley. It is a unique social philanthropic (showing concern for humanity) system of the local community. Details are available here Nomus and  Oral testimonies from Shimshal It is one of its kind model of participatory community development in Gilgit-Baltistan area of Pakistan.

Its mountains like Distaghil Sar (7,885 m), Shimshal White Horn (6,303 m) Minglik Sar (6,150 m), Lupghar Sar (7,200 m), Yazghail Sar (6,000 m), Kunjut Sar and others are well known among mountaineers. Gigantic glaciers include Malangudhi, Yazghail, Khurdopin (5,800 m), Braldu, Odver, Ver Zharav, and main passes are Chafchingoal, Khurdopin, Mai Dur, Braldu, Boi Sam and others. Shimshalis are to Pakistan as Sherpas are to Nepal. More than twenty well known mountaineers from this valley have made Pakistan proud in the field of tourism. Some people call it \" The Valley of Mountaineers\". Some of them are Rajab Shah, Mehrban Shah, Shambi Khan, Aziz Ullah, Qudrat Ali, Sarwar Ali, Shaheen Baig, Ali Musa, Amr Uddin Shah, Amin Ullah Baig, Sajjad Karim, Aziz Baig, Qurban Muhammad, Tafat Shah, Farhad Khan, Wahab Ali Shah, Fazl Ali, Hasil Shah, Yousaf Khan, Muhammad Ullah, Ezat Ullah, Muhammad Bari, Shafa Ali, Muhammad Abdul joshi, Saeed Ahmed, Jalal Uddin, mehrban karim and others. Rajab Shah has the distinction of scaling all five peaks more than eight thousand meters located in Pakistan. Rajab Shah and Mehrban Shah have received Presidential Award for Pride of Performance in recognition of their extra ordinary achievement in the field of tourism and mountaineering.\n\nThere are almost 250 houses in Shimshal and almost every house uses solar panels to generate electricity. This means that compared to other people living on high altitudes in Pakistan, Shimshal residents spend their life in a better way. On 14 December 2016 Shimshal connected with rest of the world through cellular network of the Special Communications Organization known as SCOM. Special Communications Organization also known as SCO provides GSM services in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. The SCOM GSM service is connected with solar system in Shimshal. Samina Baig who is Brand Ambassador of SCOM played vital role in providing cellular service to the people of Shimshal.\n\nNaubahar School in Shimshal produces 20KVs of electricity using solar panels. This amount of electricity is enough to meet the electricity needs of 18 classrooms and an IT lab.\n\n\n * Samina Baig hailing from Shimshal valley is the first Pakistani woman to scale the world's highest mountain Mt.Everest. She also has the honor of scaling all highest peaks in seven continents. Pakistan Youth Outreach website contains comprehensive information.\n * Mirza Ali Baig hailing from Shimshal is also a mountaineer. In addition, he is a photographer and social worker.

      "description": "Bagh District (undefined) is one of the Ten districts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. The district, which had been part of Poonch District, was created in 1988.\n\nThe district is bounded by Muzaffarabad District to the north, Poonch district to the south, and Poonch district of the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir to the east; it is bounded by the Punjab, Rawalpindi District and Abbottabad District of Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province to the west. The total area of the district is 770 square kilometers. Bagh District is linked to Muzaffarabad by two roads, one via Sudhan Gali (80 km) and the other through Kohala (97 km). It is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. The district's headquarters is located at Bagh. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by the landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named “Bagh”.\n\nThere is an archaeological site located in Bagh called Bagh Fort.\n\nPrior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\n\nThe district of Bagh is sub-divided into 2 tehsils:\n * Bagh Tehsil\n * Dhirkot Tehsil\n\n\n\nTopographically, the entire Bagh district is a mountainous area, generally sloping from northeast to south-west. The area falls in the lesser Himalayas zone. The main range in the district is Pir-Panjal.\n\nThe Haji-Pir Pass is situated at the height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. Mahl Nala (in the Bagh sub-division) and Betar Nala (in the Haveli sub-division) are the two main streams. However, numerous other rivulets flow in the district.\n\nThe climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2 °C to 40 °C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in winter and moderate in summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in winter and hot in summer. May, June and July are the hottest months. Maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40 °C and 22 °C respectively. December, January and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16 °C and minimum temperature is 3 °C respectively. Annual rainfall is about 1500 mm.\n\nThe total population of the district according to the 2017 census was 371,919.\n\nThe major language of Azad Kashmir is Pahari. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in Muzaffarabad (84% shared basic vocabulary) and with the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south(west) in the Galyat region around Murree (86–88%).\n\nAccording to Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report by Alif Ailaan, the district of Bagh is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42 and gender parity score of 88.32,\n\nThe school infrastructure score of Bagh is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126. School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Kashmir. Access to schools, schools being far away is also a reason why there are less number of enrollments, especially after completing primary school.\n\nThe city of Bagh, like other areas of the district, was heavily damaged in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Sixty percent of the buildings collapsed. Thousands of people died and many more found themselves homeless. In the aftermath of the earthquake, NATO came to the district to help with reconstruction and clearing. There was a report that an entire village was wiped out in the district. The U.S., through Pakistan, distributed vouchers so people could buy water and food.\n\n\n * Bagh Azad Jammu and Kashmir Official Portal\n * District Profile – Bagh Earthquake Reconstruction & Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) 2007",

From 1571 onwards Chitral was the dominion of the Kator Dynasty until 1969.\n\nThe entire region that now forms the Chitral District was a fully independent monarchy until 1895, when the British negotiated a subsidiary alliance with its hereditary ruler, the Mehtar, under which Chitral became a princely state, still sovereign but subject to the suzerainty of the British Raj. Chitral retained a similar status even after its accession to Pakistan in 1969, but was completely incorporated into Pakistan and became an administrative district of Pakistan in 1969.\n\nThe city has an average elevation of 1500 m.\n\nChitral has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa), with warm summers and mild winters.\n\nAccording to 1981 census, Khowar is main language and spoken by 98% of population while Pashto is spoken by small population.\n\nChitral is represented in the National Assembly and Provincial Assembly by one elected MNA and one elected MPA.\n\n* Badakhshan Province\n * Chitral Tehsil\n * Arandu\n * Drosh\n * Badakhshan Province\n\n*\n\n* United Nations\n * Government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa\n * Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Government website section on Lower Dir\n * United Nations",

This valley is situated in the east of Chitral and north of Swat. Golaghmuli Valley is separated from the Chitral and Swat by high mountain passes. To reach Golaghmuli Valley, a person must take the Gilgit-Chitral road west from Gilgit, and then continue his journey straight by Gupis. After Gupis, one continues northwest to reach the Yasin Valley and the straight road goes to Golaghmuli Valley.\n\nGolaghmuli Valley is a big part of Tehsil Phander, a new Tehsil of Ghizer District. It was formerly a part of Tehsil Gupis. In the government of PPP, it was decided to make Golaghmuli, a new Tehsil of Ghizer. But the government of PML (N) gave it the whole power of a Tehsil. Phander was originally ruled by Governor Gupis, Raja Hussain Ali Khan Maqpoon. The Rajas of Gupis were great warriors and fought against the Sikhs and the Dogras of on the freedom movement of Gilgit-Baltistan, but this house eventually lost power and the ownership of Koh-i-Ghizer at the time of FCR.\n\nGolaghmuli Valley was of strategic importance because it leads to a high mountain pass, to Laspur Valley in Chitral via Shandur Top, and then to Mastuj. Another gateway is the passage of Dadaili Pass in Handarap Nallah, which leads to Swat District.\n\nGolaghmuli Valley and Golaghmuli Valley are located in the west of District Ghizer. It includes the villages of Pingal, Rawat, Shamaran, Chashi, Golaghmuli, Golaghmuli, Golaghtori, Terich, Handarap, Handarap Nallah including Lake, Herkush, Teru, Karim Abad, Hilthi, Barset and a wide area of Khukush Nallah including Shandur.\n\nAdministratively, Tehsil Golaghmuli is a newly Tehsil and is under the jurisdiction of GB-La 30.

      "description": "Hunza (Burushaski: ہنزو, Wakhi \"shina\", and undefined) is a mountainous valley in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. Hunza is situated in the extreme northern part of Gilgit-Baltistan, bordering with the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan and the Xinjiang region of China.\n\nHunza was formerly a princely state bordering Xinjiang (autonomous region of China) to the northeast and Pamir to the northwest, which survived until 1974, when it was finally dissolved by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south and the former princely state of Nagar to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as Karimabad); another old settlement is Ganish Village which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years, until the British gained control of it and the neighbouring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through a military conquest. The then Mir/Tham (ruler) Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to Kashghar in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.\n\nAn account wrote by John Bidulf in his book 'Tribes of Hindukush'The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayeshe (heavenly). The two states of Hunza and Nagar were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of Gilgit, whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Islām Shāh 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of Islam to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of Gilgit, who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.\n\nIn 2010, a landslide blocked the river and created Attabad Lake (also called Gojal Lake), which threatened 15,000 people in the valley below and has effectively blocked 27 km of the Karakoram Highway. The new lake extends 30 km and rose to a depth of 400 ft when it was formed as the Hunza River backed up. The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.\n\n\n * Karakoram International University , Hunza Campus\n * Programs offered in KIU,Hunza\n\n. BS Mathematics\n\n.

The perilous weather conditions had made it difficult for the Army helicopter to go forth with a rescue operation on the 7,388 m high Ultar Sar. But they completed it. Bruce Normand and Timothy Miller from UK successfully rescued alive while their companion Christian Huber from Austria had succumbed to avalanche.\n\nBritain's High Commissioner Thomas Drew in Pakistan said, the mission had been “remarkable and dangerous”. ''“ Our gratitude to the Pakistan Army pilots who rescued two British climbers trapped by an avalanche on Ultar Sar Peak near Hunza. Our thoughts with their Austrian fellow climber who died ”''.\n\nThe local languages spoken include Burushaski, Wakhi and Shina. The literacy rate of the Hunza valley is more than 77%. The historical area of Hunza and present northern Pakistan has had, over the centuries, mass migrations, conflicts and resettling of tribes and ethnicities, of which the Dardic Shina race is the most prominent in regional history. People of the region have recounted their historical traditions down the generations.\n\nThe longevity of Hunza people has been noted by some, but others refute this as a longevity myth and cite a life expectancy of 110 years for men and 122 for women with a high standard deviation. There is no evidence that Hunza life expectancy is significantly above the average of poor, isolated regions of Pakistan. Claims of health and long life were almost always based solely on the statements by the local mir (king).

      "title": "Indus River",
      "description": "\n\nThe Indus River (locally called Sindhu) is one of the longest rivers in Asia. Originating in the Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of Lake Manasarovar, the river runs a course through the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, India, towards the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan and the Hindukush ranges, and then flows in a southerly direction along the entire length of Pakistan to merge into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi in Sindh. It is the longest river and national river of Pakistan.\n\nThe river has a total drainage area exceeding 1,165,000 km2. Its estimated annual flow stands at around 243 km3, twice that of the Nile River and three times that of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers combined, making it one of the largest rivers in the world in terms of annual flow. The Zanskar is its left bank tributary in Ladakh. In the plains, its left bank tributary is the Panjnad which itself has five major tributaries, namely, the Chenab, Jhelum, the Ravi, the Beas, and the Sutlej. Its principal right bank tributaries are the Shyok, the Gilgit, the Kabul, the Gomal, and the Kurram. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the Himalayan, Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, the river supports ecosystems of temperate forests, plains and arid countryside.\n\nThe northern part of the Indus Valley, with its tributaries, forms the Punjab region, while the lower course of the Indus is known as Sindh and ends in a large delta. The river has historically been important to many cultures of the region. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of a major urban civilization of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the hymns of the Hindu Rigveda as Sapta Sindhu and the Zoroastrian Avesta as Hapta Hindu (both terms meaning \"seven rivers\"). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include Gandhāra, and the Ror dynasty of Sauvīra. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the West early in the Classical Period, when King Darius of Persia sent his Greek subject Scylax of Caryanda to explore the river, ca. 515 BC.\n\nThis river was known to the ancient Indians in Sanskrit as Sindhu and the Persians as Hindu which was regarded by both of them as \"the border river\". The variation between the two names is explained by the Old Iranian sound change *s > h, which occurred between 850–600 BCE according to Asko Parpola. From the Persian Achaemenid Empire, the name passed to the Greeks as Indós (Ἰνδός). It was adopted by the Romans as Indus.\n\nThe meaning of Sindhu as a \"large body of water, sea, or ocean\" is a later meaning in Classical Sanskrit. A later Persian name for the river was Darya, which similarly has the connotations of large body of water and sea. Other variants of the name Sindhu include Assyrian Sinda (as early as the 7th century BC), Persian Ab-e-sind, Pashto Abasind, Arab Al-Sind,  Chinese Sintow, and Javanese Santri.\n\nIn other languages of the region, the river is known as सिन्धु (Sindhu) in Hindi and Nepali, سنڌو (Sindhu) in Sindhi, (Sindh) in Shahmukhi Punjabi, ਸਿੰਧ ਨਦੀ (Sindh Nadī) in Gurmukhī Punjabi, اباسين (Abāsin lit. \"Father of Rivers\") in Pashto, نهر السند (Nahar al-Sind) in Arabic, སེང་གེ་གཙང་པོ། (singi khamban lit. \"Lion River\" or Lion Spring) in Tibetan, 印度 (Yìndù) in Chinese, and Nilab in Turki.\n\nThe Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan's economy – especially the breadbasket of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation's agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means \"land of five rivers\" and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan.\n\nThe ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet; the river begins at the confluence of the Sengge Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers that drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailash) mountain ranges. The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh, India, and Baltistan into Gilgit, just south of the Karakoram range. The Shyok, Shigar and Gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south and descends into the Punjab plains at Kalabagh, Pakistan. The Indus passes gigantic gorges 4500 - 5200 m deep near the Nanga Parbat massif. It flows swiftly across Hazara and is dammed at the Tarbela Reservoir. The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the Panjnad at Mithankot. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the Satnad River (sat = \"seven\", nadī = \"river\"), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by Jamshoro, it ends in a large delta to the South of Thatta in the Sindh province of Pakistan\n\nThe Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore. The Indus system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges of Tibet, the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh and Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons – it diminishes greatly in the winter, while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times – it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake. Presently, Indus water flows in to the Rann of Kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.\n\nThe traditional source of the river is the Senge Khabab or \"Lion's Mouth\", a perennial spring, not far from the sacred Mount Kailash marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may possibly form a longer stream than Senge Khabab, but unlike the Senge Khabab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point.\n\n\n\nThe Rigveda describes several rivers, including one named \"Sindhu\". The Rigvedic \"Sindhu\" is thought to be the present-day Indus river. It is attested 176 times in its text, 94 times in the plural, and most often used in the generic sense of \"river\". In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus river in particular, e.g. in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of Nadistuti sukta. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein, except for the Bramhaputra.\n\nThe major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300 BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India, with an upward reach from east of Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan, Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only 28 km from Delhi. To date, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 90–96 of more than 800 known Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries. The Sutlej, now a tributary of the Indus, in Harappan times flowed into the Ghaggar-Hakra River, in the watershed of which were more Harappan sites than along the Indus.\n\nMost scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700 BC to 600 BC, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned.\n\nThe word \"India\" is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, \"India\" initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Indus, but by 300 BC, Greek writers including Herodotus and Megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.\n\nThe lower basin of the Indus forms a natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Indian subcontinent; this region embraces all or parts of the Pakistani provinces Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and the countries Afghanistan and India. It was crossed by the invading armies of Alexander, but after his Macedonians conquered the west bank—joining it to the Hellenic Empire, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander's Asian campaign. The Indus plains were later dominated by the Persian empire and then the Kushan empire. Over several centuries Muslim armies of Muhammad bin Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori, Tamerlane and Babur crossed the river to invade the inner regions of the Punjab and points farther south and east\n\n\n\n\n * Beas River\n * Chenab River\n * Gar River\n * Gilgit River\n * Gomal River\n * Hunza River\n * Jhelum River\n * Kabul River\n * Kunar River\n * Kurram River\n * Panjnad River\n * Ravi River\n * Shyok River\n * Soan River\n * Suru River\n * Satluj River\n * Swat River\n * Zanskar River\n * Zhob River\n\nThe Indus river feeds the Indus submarine fan, which is the second largest sediment body on the Earth. It consists of around 5 million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganga and were captured after that time. Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45 million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time. The delta of this proto-Indus river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.\n\nIn the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.\n\nIn November 2011, satellite images showed that the Indus river had re-entered India, feeding Great Rann of Kutch, Little Rann of Kutch and a lake near Ahmedabad known as Nal Sarovar. Heavy rains had left the river basin along with the Lake Manchar, Lake Hemal and Kalri Lake (all in modern-day Pakistan) inundated. This happened two centuries after the Indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake.\n\nThe Induan Age at start of the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Indus region.\n\nAccounts of the Indus valley from the times of Alexander's campaign indicate a healthy forest cover in the region, which has now considerably receded. The Mughal Emperor Babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the Baburnama). Extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the Shivalik Hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions. The Indus valley regions are arid with poor vegetation. Agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works. The Indus river and its watershed has a rich biodiversity. It is home to around 25 amphibian species.\n\nThe Indus river dolphin (Platanista indicus minor) is found only in the Indus River. It is subspecies of the South Asian river dolphin. The Indus river dolphin formerly also occurred in the tributaries of the Indus river. According to the World Wildlife Fund it is one of the most threatened cetaceans with only about 1,000 still existing.\n\nThere are two otter species in the Indus River basin: the Eurasian otter in the northeastern highland sections and the smooth-coated otter elsewhere in the river basin. The smooth-coated otters in the Indus River represent a subspecies found nowhere else, the Sindh otter (Lutrogale perspicillata sindica).\n\nThe Indus River basin has a high diversity, being the home of more than 180 freshwater fish species, including 22 which are found nowhere else. Fish also played a major role in earlier cultures of the region, including the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation where depictions of fish were frequent. The Indus script has a commonly used fish sign, which in its various forms may simply have meant \"fish\", or referred to stars or gods.\n\nIn the uppermost, highest part of the Indus River basin there are relatively few genera and species: Diptychus, Ptychobarbus, Schizopyge, Schizopygopsis and Schizothorax snowtrout, Triplophysa loaches, and the catfish Glyptosternon reticulatum. Going downstream these are soon joined by the golden mahseer Tor putitora (alternatively T. macrolepis, although it often is regarded as a synonym of T. putitora) and Schistura loaches. Downriver from around Thakot, Tarbela, the Kabul–Indus river confluence, Attock Khurd and Peshawar the diversity rises strongly, including many cyprinids (Amblypharyngodon, Aspidoparia, Barilius, Chela, Cirrhinus, Crossocheilus, Cyprinion, Danio, Devario, Esomus, Garra, Labeo, Naziritor, Osteobrama, Pethia, Puntius, Rasbora, Salmophasia, Securicula and Systomus), true loaches (Botia and Lepidocephalus), stone loaches (Acanthocobitis and Nemacheilus), ailiid catfish (Clupisoma), bagridae catfish (Batasio, Mystus, Rita and Sperata), airsac catfish (Heteropneustes), schilbid catfish (Eutropiichthys), silurid catfish (Ompok and Wallago), sisorid catfish (Bagarius, Gagata, Glyptothorax and Sisor), gouramis (Trichogaster), nandid leaffish (Nandus), snakeheads (Channa), spiny eel (Macrognathus and Mastacembelus), knifefish (Notopterus), glassfish (Chanda and Parambassis), clupeids (Gudusia), needlefish (Xenentodon) and gobies (Glossogobius), as well as a few introduced species. As the altitude further declines the Indus basin becomes overall quite slow-flowing as it passes through the Punjab Plain. Major carp become common, and chameleonfish (Badis), mullet (Sicamugil) and swamp eel (Monopterus) appear. In some upland lakes and tributaries of the Punjab region snowtrout and mahseer are still common, but once the Indus basin reaches its lower plain the former group is entirely absent and the latter are rare. Many of the species of the middle sections of the Indus basin are also present in the lower. Notable examples of genera that are present in the lower plain but generally not elsewhere in the Indus River basin are the Aphanius pupfish, Aplocheilus killifish, palla fish (Tenualosa ilisha), catla (Labeo catla), rohu (Labeo rohita) and Cirrhinus mrigala. The lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to freshwater fish, but also a number of brackish and marine species. This includes including pomfret and prawns. The large delta has been recognized by conservationists as an important ecological region. Here, the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels.\n\nPalla fish (Tenualosa ilisha) of the river is a delicacy for people living along the river. The population of fish in the river is moderately high, with Sukkur, Thatta, and Kotri being the major fishing centres – all in the lower Sindh course. As a result, damming and irrigation has made fish farming an important economic activity.\n\nThe Indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the Punjab and Sindh plains – it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Indus valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, and later by the engineers of the Kushan Empire and the Mughal Empire. Modern irrigation was introduced by the British East India Company in 1850 – the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The Guddu Barrage is 1350 m long – irrigating Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Kalat. The Sukkur Barrage serves over 20000 km2.\n\nAfter Pakistan came into existence, a water control treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River and its two tributaries the Jhelum River & the Chenab River independently of upstream control by India.\n\nThe Indus Basin Project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams, the Mangla Dam built on the Jhelum River and the Tarbela Dam constructed on the Indus River, together with their subsidiary dams. The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority undertook the construction of the Chashma-Jhelum link canal – linking the waters of the Indus and Jhelum rivers – extending water supplies to the regions of Bahawalpur and Multan. Pakistan constructed the Tarbela Dam near Rawalpindi – standing 2743 m long and 143 m high, with an 80 km long reservoir. It supports the Chashma Barrage near Dera Ismail Khan for irrigation use and flood control and the Taunsa Barrage near Dera Ghazi Khan which also produces 100,000 kilowatts of electricity. The Kotri Barrage near Hyderabad is 915 m long and provides additional water supplies for Karachi. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of Peshawar, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for Pakistan's large production of crops such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat. The dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centers.\n\nThe inhabitants of the regions are mainly Muslim as Pakistan is an Islamic country through which the Indus river passes and forms a major natural feature and resource are diverse in ethnicity, religion, national and linguistic backgrounds. On the northern course of the river in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India, live the Buddhist people of Ladakh, of Tibetan stock, and the Dards of Indo-Aryan or Dardic stock and practising Islam. Then it descends into Baltistan, northern Pakistan passing the main Balti city of Skardu. A river from Dubair Bala also drains into it at Dubair Bazar. People living in this area are mainly Kohistani and speak the Kohistani language. Major areas through which the Indus river passes in Kohistan are Dasu, Pattan and Dubair. As it continues through Pakistan, the Indus river forms a distinctive boundary of ethnicity and cultures – upon the western banks the population is largely Pashtun, Baloch, and of other Iranian stock. The eastern banks are largely populated by people of Indo-Aryan stock, such as the Punjabis and the Sindhis. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside Dardic people in the hills (Khowar, Kalash, Shina, etc.), Burushos (in Hunza), and Punjabi people.\n\nThe people living along the Indus river speak Punjabi and Sindhi on the eastern side (in Punjab and Sindh provinces respectively), Pushto plus Balochi as well as Barohi (in Khyber Pakhtoonkha and Baluchistan provinces). In the province of Sindh, the upper third of the river is inhabited by people speaking Saraiki; which is a somewhat transitional dialect of the Punjabi and Sindhi languages.\n\nThe Indus is a strategically vital resource for Pakistan's economy and society. After Pakistan and India declared Independence from the British Raj, the use of the waters of the Indus and its five eastern tributaries became a major dispute between India and Pakistan. The irrigation canals of the Sutlej valley and the Bari Doab were split – with the canals lying primarily in Pakistan and the headwork dams in India disrupting supply in some parts of Pakistan. The concern over India building large dams over various Punjab rivers that could undercut the supply flowing to Pakistan, as well as the possibility that India could divert rivers in the time of war, caused political consternation in Pakistan. Holding diplomatic talks brokered by the World Bank, India and Pakistan signed the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960. The treaty gave India control of the three easternmost rivers of the Punjab, the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi, while Pakistan gained control of the three western rivers, the Jhelum, the Chenab and the Indus. India retained the right to use of the western rivers for non-irrigation projects.\n\nLarge-scale diversion of the river's water for irrigation has raised far-reaching issues. Sediment clogging from poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation on numerous occasions. Irrigation itself is increasing soil salinization, reducing crop yields and in some cases rendering farmland useless for cultivation. And ecologically, the reduced flow of fresh water and silt into the Indus delta is threatening the area's mangrove forests.\n\nThere are also concerns that the Indus River may be shifting its course westwards, although the progression spans centuries.\n\nOriginally, the delta used to receive almost all of the water from the Indus river, which has an annual flow of approximately 180 e9m3, and is accompanied by 400 e6tonnes of silt. Since the 1940s, dams, barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river Indus. The Indus Basin Irrigation System is the \"largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years\" anywhere in the world. This has reduced the flow of water and by 2018, the average annual flow of water below the Kotri barrage was 33 e9m3, and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated at 100 e6tonnes. As a result, the 2010 Pakistan floods were considered \"good news\" for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much needed fresh water. Any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible.\n\nVegetation and wildlife of the Indus delta are threatened by the reduced inflow of fresh water, along with extensive deforestation, industrial pollution and global warming. Damming has also isolated the delta population of Indus River dolphins from those further upstream.\n\nThe Tibetan Plateau contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term, but issued a strong warning:\n\n\n\n\"There is insufficient data to say what will happen to the Indus,\" says David Grey, the World Bank's senior water advisor in South Asia. \"But we all have very nasty fears that the flows of the Indus could be severely, severely affected by glacier melt as a consequence of climate change,\" and reduced by perhaps as much as 50 percent. \"Now what does that mean to a population that lives in a desert [where], without the river, there would be no life? I don't know the answer to that question,\" he says. \"But we need to be concerned about that. Deeply, deeply concerned.\"\n\nU.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke said, shortly before his death in 2010, that he believed that falling water levels in the Indus River \"could very well precipitate World War III.\"\n\nOver the years factories on the banks of the Indus River have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it. High levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered Indus River Dolphin. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency has ordered polluting factories around the river to shut down under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997. Death of the Indus River Dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using poison to kill fish and scooping them up. As a result, the government banned fishing from Guddu Barrage to Sukkur.\n\nComing second after the Yangtze, and together with 9 other rivers, the Indus transports 90 % of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.\n\n\n\nFrequently, Indus river is prone to moderate to severe flooding. In July 2010, following abnormally heavy monsoon rains, the Indus River rose above its banks and started flooding. The rain continued for the next two months, devastating large areas of Pakistan. In Sindh, the Indus burst its banks near Sukkur on 8 August, submerging the village of Mor Khan Jatoi. In early August, the heaviest flooding moved southward along the Indus River from severely affected northern regions toward western Punjab, where at least 1,400,000 acres of cropland was destroyed, and the southern province of Sindh. , over two thousand people had died and over a million homes had been destroyed since the flooding began.\n\nThe 2011 Sindh floods began during the Pakistani monsoon season in mid-August 2011, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Sindh, eastern Balochistan, and southern Punjab. The floods caused considerable damage; an estimated 434 civilians were killed, with 5.3 million people and 1,524,773 homes affected. Sindh is a fertile region and often called the \"breadbasket\" of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy was said to be extensive. At least 1.7 e6acre of arable land were inundated. The flooding followed the previous year's floods, which devastated a large part of the country. Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh.\n\nIn Pakistan currently there are three barrages on the Indus: Guddu barrage, Sukkur Barrage, and Kotri barrage (also called Ghulam Muhammad barrage). There are some bridges on river Indus, such as, Dadu Moro Bridge, Larkana Khairpur Indus River Bridge, Thatta-Sujawal bridge, Jhirk-Mula Katiar bridge and recently planned Kandhkot-Ghotki bridge.\n\nKala Bagh Barrage, Chasma Barrage, and Taunsa Barrage are also built in Punjab on the Indus.\n\nThe entire left bank of Indus river in Sind province is protected from river flooding by constructing around 600 km long levees. The right bank side is also leveed from Guddu barrage to Lake Manchar. In response to the levees construction, the river has been aggrading rapidly over the last 20 years leading to breaches upstream of barrages and inundation of large areas.\n\nTarbela Dam in Pakistan is constructed on the Indus River, while the controversial Kalabagh dam is also being constructed on Indus river.\n\n\n\n\n * Chura Sharif\n * Ghaggar-Hakra River\n * HMS Indus\n * Indus Valley Civilisation\n * Rivers of Jammu and Kashmir\n * Sarasvati River\n * Sind Sagar Doab\n * Sindhology\n * Sindhu Darshan Festival\n * Sindhu Pushkaram\n * Rigvedic rivers\n\n\n\n* Jean Fairley, \"The Lion River\", Karachi, 1978.\n * Albinia, Alice.

      "description": "\n\nKhaplu (Urdu and Balti:), also spelt Khapalu, is a town that serves as the administrative capital of the Ghanche District of Gilgit-Baltistan, in northern Pakistan. Lying 103 km east of the town of Skardu, it was the second-largest kingdom in old Baltistan of the Yabgo dynasty. It guarded the trade route to Ladakh along the Shyok River.\n\nThe Khaplu Valley is 103 kilometres (64 miles) from Skardu and two hours by jeep. It is a sprawling village located at the confluence of the Indus and the Shyok Rivers in Pakistan.\n\nKhaplu is a base for trekking into the Hushe valley which leads to Masherbrum mountains. Many famous mountains, such as Masherbrum, K-6, K-7, Sherpi Kangh, Sia Kangri, Saltoro Kangri and Siachen etc. are located there. According to Forbes Magazine, Khaplu is the coolest place for tourists. Anuually approximate 100 thousand tourists visit Khaplu to see Siachen Glacier and 3rd 4th 5th and 6th highest peak of the world. Khaplu has a mosque naming Chaqchan, a 700 hundred years old mosque, founded by Ameer Kabeer Syed Ali Hamadani(RA). Tourist Places. Hanjor, ThoqsiKhar, Kaldaq, Chaqchan Mosque, and Shyok River view are known tourist places in Khaplu town.\n\nThe first mention of the former small kingdom called Khápula is in Mirza Haidar's (1499–1551) famous work Tarikh-i-Rashidi (p. 410). The author lists the Khaplu district of Balti(stan). Khaplu was also very well known in the 17th and 18th century due to its close political and family ties with the royal family of the neighbouring country of Ladakh.\n\nThe first European to visit Khaplu was probably Captain Claude Martin Wade (1794–1861), who mentioned \"Chílú\" in 1835 in a Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal essay. Subsequently, William Moorcroft and George Trebeck wrote in their 1841 book (Part II, p 264): \"Kafalun is a province west of Nobra, on the left bank of the Shayuk.\" Godfrey Thomas Vigne has Khaplu 1835-1838, relying in particular on the local mountain fortress, commented that he was still in an intact condition vorfand (Part 2, pp. 317f). Alexander Cunningham (p. 28ff), who did not visit Baltistan, published a brief geographical description of Khaplu and a genealogy of its rulers in 1854. Thomas Thomson travelled in November 1847 and briefly described a place of remarkable beauty for Tibet (p. 210ff). Knight reported on his visit to Khaplu (p. 253): \"This fair spot what Kapalu, the richest district in Baltistan, and Regarded as a very Garden of Eden by the Balti people.\" Jane E. Duncan reached Khaplu in 1904 and stayed there for three weeks. A detailed report on her stay in Khaplu is well worth reading. De Filippi, who reached Khaplu in 1913, characterized the site as follows: \"It is, perhaps, the loveliest oasis in all the region.\" Further information on Khaplu was included in a travel report by Arthur Neve (p. 99f). Recent descriptions can be found in the guidebooks Arora, pp. 211f, Lonely Planet, pp. 306f and Beek, pp. 252ff.\n\nIn contrast to Skardu and Shigar, the territory of Khaplu was not focused on a single large river valley, but was instead spread over the three valleys of Shayok, namely on the territory of the present town of Khaplu, the valley of Thalle River, and the Hushe / Saltoro valley. The area around the mouth of the river in the Thalle Shayok formed the western border of the kingdom. Today Gangche district, whose administrative centre is located in Khaplu, covers Balghar and Daghoni in addition to the mouth of the Indus in Shayok. It includes the former Kingdom of Kiris as a military bulwark of the West against the incursions of the archenemies Skardu and Shigar the mountain fortresses of Kharku were next to a castle in Balghar and saling been built. In Haldi, in eastern Hushe / Saltoro Tal, was another fortress. The fortress in the town of Khar Thortsi Khaplu was viewed as militarily impregnable and the area's most important defence system.\n\nKhaplu has been called many names like \"Shyok Valley,\" \"Ghangche\" and \"Little Tibet.\" In Khaplu there are many historical places like the beautiful Chaqchan Mosque (700 years old founded by Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, the first Islam preacher in this area). Raja Palace is a beautiful building and the last and best Tibetan-style palace in Pakistan. Khaplu Khanqah is attributed to Mir Mukhtar Akhyar and was built in 1712 AD/1124 AH.\n\nKhaplu is the gateway to Masherbrum Peak, K-7, K-6, Chogolisa for mountaineers and Gondogoro la, Gondogoro Peak, Saraksa Glacier, Gondogoro Glacier, Masherbrum Glacier, Aling Glacier, Machlu Broq, Thaely La, Daholi lake, Kharfaq Lake, Ghangche Lake and Bara Lake for trekkers. Khaplu is a scenic place for hiking like Khaplu Braq, Khaplu Thung and Hanjoor, Kaldaq, Kholi, Ehli. There is rafting on the Shyok River and rock climbing places like Biamari Thoqsikhar and DowoKraming (hot spring).\n\nThe most important religious monuments in Khaplu are the great Khanqa prayer hall and the Chaqchan Mosque. The former was built in 1712 by Sayyed Mohammad, a saint of the Islamic Nūrbkahshīya sect, whose Astana grave monument is in the immediate vicinity. The Astana grave monument has been restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Pakistan and thereby saved from total disintegration. The Chaqchan Mosque is the largest and most important of the traditional mosques in Baltistan. After Klimburg (p. 155) its establishment as the Amburiq Mosque in Shigar Islamic missionary Sayyed Ali Shah Hamadani is attributed (14th century), which is considered historically as not secured like the Amburiq Mosque.\n\nKhaplu is only approachable by road. The normal road route into Khaplu is by a link road from the Skardu Valley. There are four or five other road links to Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nA famous all-weather Khaplu-Drass road linked Khaplu with Drass, a city in Ladakh. Since the annexation of Gilgit Baltistan by Pakistan, the road has been closed. However, nowadays there are a few helipads (helicopter landing pads).\n\n\n * Shridhar Kaul: Ladakh through the Ages, towards a New Identity.

It is one of the scenic valleys of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a picturesque spot for travelers. Every summer season thousands of tourists from different areas of the country visit to Kumrat valley and enjoy the greenery and cool weather.\n\nKumrat is covered with green pastures, snow clad mountains, the river Panjkora, foggy mounds and forests are attractions of the region, which serve as habitats for variety of flora and fauna. It is located in the Upper Dir Kohistan region at the back side of which Swat Kohistan area of Gabral is located.\n\nThe Kumrat Valley's unique selling proposition for the last few years are it's towering Deodar forest trees located on level ground adjacent the Panjkora river. Although the valley is relatively less green as compared to the Neelam Valley on the whole, the unique storybook ambiance formed by the Deodar forests has continued to attract tourists for several years.\n\nDeodar forest is fast depleting in Dir kohistan valley and it continues unhindered as the locals claim they have no other source of heating and cooking in the harsh winter season. The people of Kohistan valley had offered the government a few years back that they were ready stop cutting deodar trees if they were provided with the natural gas facility. However, the government did not pay any heed to their demand.\n\n\n * Kaghan Valley\n * Ushirai Dara\n * Laram Top\n * Jahaz Banda\n\n",

      "title": "Neelum District",
      "description": "Neelum District (also spelt as Neelam; undefined), is the northernmost district of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Taking up the larger part of the Neelam Valley, the district has a population of (as of 2017). It was badly affected by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.\n\nThe Neelum River was known before Partition as Kishan Ganga and was subsequently renamed after the village of Neelam. It flows down from the Gurez Valley in Indian Jammu and Kashmir and roughly follows first a western and then a south-western course until it joins the Jhelum River at Muzaffarabad. The valley is a thickly wooded region with an elevation ranging between 4000 ft and 7500 ft, the mountain peaks on either side reaching 17000 ft. Neelum Valley is 144 km long.\n\nMost of the valley is taken up by the Neelum District(undefined). The district is bordered on the south-west by Muzaffarabad District, which also encompasses the lower reaches of the valley; to the north-west beyond the mountains lies the Kaghan Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mansehra District; to the north and north-east are the Diamer, Astore and Skardu districts of Gilgit-Baltistan. To the south and east are the Kupwara and Bandipora districts of Indian Kashmir. The Line of Control runs through the valley – either across the mountains to the south-east, or in places right along the river, with several villages on the left bank falling on the Indian side of the border.\n\nNeelum District was part of Muzaffarabad District until 2005. It is made up of two tehsils: Athmuqam, which contains the district headquarters, and Sharda. Neelum District is the largest district of Azad Kashmir by area. The valley extends for approximately 200 kilometers along the Neelum River. This is a generally poor region, reliant on subsistence agriculture and handicrafts, with tourism growing in importance in recent years. According to the Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2015, Neelum is ranked 33 out of 148 districts in terms of education. For facilities and infrastructure, the district is ranked 136 out of 148.\n\nSeveral languages are spoken natively in the district. The predominant one is Hindko. It is the language of wider communication in the area, and is spoken at a native or near-native level by almost all members of the other language communities, many of whom are abandoning their language and shifting to Hindko. This language is usually called Parmi (or Parimi, Pārim), a name that likely originated in the Kashmiri word apārim 'from the other side', which was the term used by the Kashmiris of the Vale of Kashmir to refer to the highlanders, who spoke this language. The language is also sometimes known as Pahari, although it bears closer resemblance to the Hindko of neighbouring Kaghan Valley than to the Pahari spoken in the Murree Hills. Unlike other varieties of Hindko, Pahari or Punjabi, it has preserved the voiced aspirated consonants at the start of the word: for example gha 'grass' vs. Punjabi kà, where the aspiration and voicing have been lost giving rise to a low tone on the following vowel. This sound change however is currently spreading here as well, but it has so far only affected the villages situated along the Neelam highway. This variety of Hindko is also spoken in nearby areas of India-administered Kashmir. Since Partition, the language varieties on either side of the Line of Control have diverged in a number of ways. For example, in the Neelam Valley there is a higher proportion of Urdu loanwords, while the variety spoken across the Line of Control has retained more traditional Hindko words.\n\nThe second most widely spoken language of the Neelam Valley is Kashmiri. It is the majority language in at least a dozen or so villages, and in about half of these it is it the sole mother tongue. It is closer to the variety spoken in northern Kashmir (particularly Kupwara) than to the Kashmiri of the city of Muzaffarabad.\n\nThe third largest ethnic, though not linguistic, group are the Gujjars, whose villages are scattered throughout the valley. Most of them have switched to Hindko, but a few communities continue using the Gujari language at home. Gujari is more consistently maintained among the Bakarwal, who travel into the valley (and beyond into Gilgit-Baltistan) with their herds in the summer and who spend the winters in the lower parts of Azad Kashmir and in Punjab.\n\nIn the upper end of the valley there are two distinct communities speaking two different varieties of Shina (locally sometimes called Dardi). One of them is found at Taobutt and the nearby village of Karimabad (formerly known as Sutti) near the border with India. Its speakers claim that their variety of Shina is close to the one spoken further up the valley in Indian Gurez. The community is bilingual in Kashmiri and is culturally closer to the neighbouring Kashmiri communities than to the other Shina group, who inhabit the large village of Phulwei 35 km downstream. The Shina people of Phullwei claim to have originally come from Nait near Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nA Pashto dialect is spoken in two villages (Dhaki and Changnar) that are situated on the Line of Control. Because of cross-border firing since the early 1990s, there has been large-scale migration away from these villages. The local dialect is not completely intelligible with the ones spoken in the rest of Pakistan.\n\nOne language that is unique to the Neelam Valley is the endangered Kundal Shahi. It is spoken by some of the inhabitants of the Kundal Shahi village near Athmuqam.\n\nAdditionally, Urdu is spoken by the formally educated and, like English, is used as a medium of instruction in schools.\n\n\n\nTourist attractions include:\n * Arang Kel\n * Athmuqam\n * Chitta Katha Lake\n * Dhani Waterfall\n * Dowarian\n * Ratti Gali Lake\n * Halmat\n * Kel\n * Keran\n * Kutton\n * Sharda\n * Taobat\n\nNeelum Valley has three sub-valleys within itself. These are Jagran sub-valley can be accessed from Kundalshahi. Babboon sub-valley can be accessed from Upper Neelum. Shounter Valley can be accessed from Kel.\n * Leswa Valley\n * Jagran Valley\n * Babboon Valley\n * Shounter Valley\n * Salkhala Valley\n * Lawat bala valley\n * Patlean lake\n\nAccording to Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report released by Alif Ailaan , the district of Neelum stands at number 58 nationally in the ranking related to education with an education score of 60.87. Neelum is lowest ranked district in all of Azad Kashmir.\n\nLike the rest of Kashmir, beyond primary education is a problem for the students as the number of schools catering for beyond primary education are less.\n\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, Neelum district ranks at 144 nationally, with school infrastructure score of 21.04 which is low and shows how poor the buildings and furniture are. Issues reported in TaleemDo! App  by students of Neelum mainly focus around no proper furniture and building walls in schools, as reflected in the poor infrastructure score. Another issue reported was that there is a place in Neelum which still doesn’t have a school building. Students have to receive education in miserable conditions.\n\n\n * Hunza Valley\n * Kaghan Valley\n * Swat Valley\n * Kalasha Valleys\n * Kumrat Valley\n * Sharada Peeth\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n * Premier Tour Operator of Neelum Valley\n * Neelum Valley Tour\n * Attractions and Places to visit in Neelum Valley",

Naltar is a forested region known for its dramatic mountain scenery.\n\nSki competitions are held at Naltar ski resort. Naltar Bala and Naltar Pine are two villages of Naltar valley. N.Pine Is at a distance of 34 kilometers (21 mi) and Naltar Bala at 40 kilometers (25 mi) from Gilgit. There is a main village known as Nomal between Naltar valley and Gilgit. A road from Nomal goes to 'The Silk Route' to China.\n\nRecently government has constructed an 18 MW hydropower plant, Naltar Hydropower Plant-IV (operational since October 2007), near Naltar Pine, in addition to two smaller hydel power generating plants (Naltar I, II of 2.28 MW combined) already there, to fulfill the power requirement of the area as well as Gilgit. Naltar-III and Naltar-V Hydropower Projects of 16 MW and 14.4 MW generation capacity respectively are under construction.\n\nThe road from Gilgit to Naltar Pine is metalled and is non-metalled from Naltar Pine to Naltar Bala.\n\nEducation rate in this valley is very poor. A government high school and an NLI public school is there at Naltar Bala and a middle school for girls is under construction. Provincial Government is not taking the issues serious. Although Naltar Valley has a good potential of tourism therefore it is the demand of local people to run a skill development institute which will produce skilled labor for tourist industry in the valley.\n\nThe Naltar Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in the valley that was established on 22 November 1975.\n\nThere are three lakes in the Naltar valley known as 'Bashkiri Lakes' at a distance of 13 kilometers (8 mi) from Naltar Bala. The road from village to the lakes is nonmetallic and narrow alongside a stream throughout this road coming from the mountains. In winter it is almost impossible to reach the lake through any vehicle due to the snow (10 to 15 feet high) on the road.\n\nNaltar Lakes are locally known as \"Chimo Bari(fish Lake)\", \" Chakar Bari(Multi Ends lake)' & \"Bodolok Bari(Turbid Lake)\".\n\nNaltar Valley is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Northern Pakistan. The valley offers a variety of flora, fauna as well as natural scenery. Government has established a number of rest houses in the valley. GBPWD Rest house is the oldest rest house in the valley.

      "title": "Swat District",
      "description": "Swat District (سوات ولسوالۍ, ضِلع سوات) ) is a district in Malakand Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Swat is renowned for its outstanding natural beauty. Centred upon the upper portions of the Swat River, Swat was a major centre of early Buddhist thought as part of the Gandhara kingdom, and today is littered with ruins from that era. Swat was home to the last isolated pockets of Gandharan Buddhism, which lasted until the 11th century, well after most of the area had converted to Islam. Until 1969, Swat was part of the Yusafzai State of Swat, a self-governing princely state. The region was seized by the Pakistani Taliban in late 2007, and its tourist industry decimated until Pakistani control over Swat was re-established in mid 2009.\n\nSwat's capital is Saidu Sharif, though the largest city, and main commercial centre, is the nearby city of Mingora. With a population of 2,309,570 according to the 2017 census, Swat is the 15th-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The region is inhabited largely by Pashtuns, except in the valley's uppermost reaches, where the Kohistani people dominate.\n\nSwat's average elevation is 980 m, resulting in a considerably cooler and wetter climate compared to most of Pakistan. With lush forests, verdant alpine meadows, and snow-capped mountains, Swat is one of the country's most popular tourist destinations.\n\n\n\nThe name \"Swat\" is of Sanskrit origin. One theory derives it from \"Suvastu\", the ancient name of the Swat River (Suastus in Greek literature); \"Suvastu\" literally means \"clear azure water\", and is attested in the earliest Sanskrit text, the Rigveda. Another theory derives the word Swat from the Sanskrit word \"Shveta\" (white), also used to describe the clear water of the Swat River.\n\n\n\nIn 327 BC, Alexander the Great fought his way to Odigram and Barikot and stormed their battlements. In Greek accounts these towns have been identified as Ora and Bazira. Around the 2nd century BC, the area was occupied by Buddhists, who were attracted by the peace and serenity of the land. There are many remains that testify to their skills as sculptors and architects. Later some Dilazak entered the area along with Sultans from Kunar and their tribe was styled as Swatis. The originator of the present family of Swat was the Muslim saint Akhund Abdul Gaffur, more commonly known as Saidu Baba. He was a pious man and the people respected him so greatly that they called him Akhund Sahib.\n\nHistorically known as Uddiyana, Tantric Buddhism flourished under King Indrabhuti, however, there is an old and well-known scholarly dispute as to whether Uddiyana was in the Swat valley, Orissa or some other place. Padmasambhava (flourished eighth century AD), also called Guru Rimpoche, Tibetan Slob-upon (teacher), or Padma 'Byung-gas (lotus born), semi-legendary Indian Buddhist mystic who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet was, according to tradition, native from Uddiyana. He is revered as the second Buddha in Tibet. Padmasambhava is said to be the son of Indrabhuti, king of Swat in the early eighth century AD and one of the original Siddhas. Indrabhuti's sister, Lakshminkaradevi, is also said being an accomplished Siddha of the 9th century AD.\n\nAncient Gandhara, the valley of Pekhawar, with the adjacent hilly regions of Swat and Buner, Dir and Bajaur was one of the earliest centers of Buddhist religion and culture following the reign of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, in the third century BC. The name Gandhara first occurs in the Rigveda which is usually identified with the region\n\nThe Gandhara school is credited with the first representations of the Buddha in human form, rather symbolically as the wheel of the law, the tree, etc.\n\nSwat was ruled by the Hindu Shahi dynasty, who built an extensive array of temples and other architectural buildings, now in ruins. Sanskrit may have been the lingua franca of the locals.\n\nHindu Shahi rulers built fortresses to guard and tax the commerce through this area. Their ruins can be seen in the hills of Swat: at Malakand pass at Swat's southern entrance.\n\nAt the end of the Mauryan period (324–185 BC) Buddhism spread in the whole Swat valley, which became a very famous center of Buddhist religion.\n\nAfter a Buddhist phase the Hindu religion reasserted itself, so that at the time of the Muslim conquest (1000 AD) the population was solidly Hindu.\n\n\n\nIn 1023, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked Swat and crushed the last Buddhist King, Raja Gira in battle. The invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni is of special importance because of the introduction of Islam as well as changing the Chronology.\n\nThe first Muslim arrivals in Swat were Pakhtun Dilazak tribes from south-east Afghanistan. These were later ousted by Swati Pakhtuns, who was succeeded in the sixteenth century by Yusufzai Pakhtuns. Both groups of Pakhtuns came from the Kandahar and Kabul valley.\n\nSwat Valley, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, has many Buddhist carvings, statues, and stupas. The town of Jehanabad contains a Seated Buddha statue. Kushan era Buddhist stupas and statues in Swat valley were demolished by the Taliban, and after two attempts by the Taliban, the Jehanabad Buddha's face was dynamited. Only the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, which the Taliban also demolished, were larger than the Buddha statue in Swat. The government did nothing to safeguard the statue after the initial attempt at destroying the Buddha, which did not cause permanent harm; when the second attack took place on the statue, the feet, shoulders, and face were demolished. Islamists (particularly the Taliban) and looters destroyed many of Pakistan's Buddhist artifacts, which dated to the Buddhist Gandhara civilization. The Taliban deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction. Gandhara artifacts were thereafter plundered by thieves and smugglers. In 2009, the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Diocsece of Lahore, Lawrence John Saldanha, wrote a letter to Pakistan's government denouncing the Taliban activities in Swat Valley, including their destruction of Buddha statues, and their attacks on Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus. A group of Italians helped repair the Buddha.\n\nSwat is surrounded by Chitral, Upper Dir and Lower Dir in the West, Gilgit-Baltistan in North Kohistan, Buner and Shangla in the East and South East. The southern tehsil of Buner was granted the status of a separate district in 1991. The valley of Swat is situated in the north of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and is enclosed by sky-high mountains.\n\nPhysical Features: Swat can be divided into two physical regions:\n\n\n * 1) Mountainous Ranges.\n * 2) Plains.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Swat lies in the lap of mountainous ranges, which are the offshoots of Hindukush, so the larger part of Swat is covered with high mountains and hills, the crests of which are hidden by everlasting snow. Though these gigantic ranges run irregularly: some to the west while the others to the east, but the general direction is North-South.\n\nThe length of the valley from Landakay to Gabral is 91 miles. Two narrow strips of plains run along the banks of Swat River from Landakay to Madyan. Beyond Madyan in Kohistan-e-Swat, the plain is too little to be mentioned. So far as the width concerns, it is not similar, it varies from place to place. We can say that the average width is 5 miles. The widest portion of the valley is between Barikot and Khwaza Khela. The widest viewpoint and the charming sight where a major portion of the valley is seen is at Gulibagh on the main road, which leads to Madyan.\n\nApproximately 38% of economy of Swat depends on Tourism and 31% depends on Agriculture.\n\nGwalerai village located near Mingora is one of those few villages which produces 18 varieties of apples due to its temperate climate in summer. The apple produced here is consumed in Pakistan as well as exported to other countries. It is known as ‘the apple of Swat’. Swat is famous for peach production mostly grown in the valley bottom plains and accounts for about 80% of the peach production of the country. Mostly marketed in the national markets with a brand name of \"Swat Peaches\". The supply starts from April and continues till September because of a diverse range of varieties grown.\n\nThe population of Swat District is 2,309,570 as per the 2017 census, making it the third-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after Peshawar District and Mardan District. Swat is populated mostly by ethnic Pashtuns and Gujjar and Kohistani communities. The language spoken in the valley is Pashto, with a minority of Torwali and Kalami speakers in the Swat Kohistan region of Upper Swat.\n\nPashtuns of the Yusufzai,\n\nAlongside the Gujjar Nation.\n\nThe District of Swat is subdivided into 7 Tehsils i.e.\n * 1) Babuzai\n * 2) Matta\n * 3) Khwaza Khela\n * 4) Barikot\n * 5) Kabal\n * 6) Charbagh\n * 7) Bahrain\n\nEach Tehsil comprises certain numbers of Union councils. There are 65 Union councils in District Swat: 56 rural and 9 urban.\n\nAccording to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act 2013. There were new system introduced called as Local Governments which have District Swat has 67 Wards, of which total amount of Village Councils is 170, and Neighbourhood Councils is 44.\n\nThe region elects three male members of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNAs), one female MNA, seven male members of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (MPAs) and two female MPAS. In the 2002 National and Provincial elections, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an alliance of religious political parties, won all the seats.\n\n\n\nMarghazar 16 km away from Saidu Sharif is famous for its Sufed Mahal the white marble palace built by the first Wali (ruler) of Swat. It used to be the ruler's summer residence. Elizabeth II (Queen of England) and Prince Philip (Duke of Edinburgh) were also hosted there in 1961. Elizabeth II described it as \"the Switzerland of the East\" during the visit. The marble used to build White Palace was the same marble which was used to build Taj Mahal. It was turned into a hotel.\n\nFizagat Park is a recreation arena for the tourists and the locals situated at 1 kilometre from Mingora city. Situated along the bank of the River Swat, tourists enjoy the bath and pleasant climate in summer.\n\nMalam Jabba (also Maalam Jabba, Urdu: مالم جبہ) is a Hill Station in the lower Swat mountain ranges nearly 42 km from Saidu Sharif in Swat Valley, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is 314 km from Islamabad and 51 km from Saidu Sharif Airport. Malam Jabba is home to the largest ski resort in Pakistan. On the main Madyan-Kalam road, the road turns to the right at Manglor town (12 km from Saidu Sharif), for the Malam-Jabba Dara which has a series of small villages and settlements like Salanda, Jehanabad, Talegraam, Badar, Ser, Malam, Kishora, Spine Oba, and finally Jabba. Malam is a small village which comes prior to Kishora village on the main Malam-Jabba road. Malam is nearly 17 km from Manglor while Kishora is at 18 km distance. Jabba (12 km from Kishore) is the uppermost part of the whole Dara (gorge). The Malam Jabba ski resort, owned by the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, had a ski slope of about 800 m with the highest point of the slope 2804 m (pabove sea level. Malam Jabba Ski Resort was the joint effort of the Pakistan government with its Austrian counterpart. The resort was equipped with modern facilities including roller/ice-skating rinks, chair lifts, skiing platforms, telephones and snow clearing equipment.

      "title": "Soon Valley",
      "description": "The Soon Valley (undefined) is in the north west of Khushab District, Punjab, Pakistan. Its largest settlement is the town of Naushera. The valley extends from the village of Padhrar to Sakesar, the highest peak in the Salt Range. The valley is 35 mi long and has an average width of 9 mi. It covers a 300 sqmi area. Soon Valley has much scenic beauty, with lakes, waterfalls, jungle, natural pools and ponds. The valley has been settled since ancient times, including by the Awan tribe, whose descendants still live in the valley.\n\nThe peak of Mount Sakesar is at 5010 ft above sea level. It was once the summer headquarters of the Deputy Commissioners of three districts - Campbelpur (now Attock), Mianwali and Shahpur (now Sargodha). It is the only mountain in this part of the Punjab which receives snowfall in winter. In the late 1950s the Pakistan Air Force placed a radar station on Sarkesar to monitor airspace over north-eastern Pakistan. Also on the mountain is a television transmission center with which the Pakistan Television Corporation relays its transmissions to the surrounding area.\n\n\n * Distance from Islamabad: 170 km\n * Distance from Sargodha: 90 km\n * Distance from Lahore: 300 km\n * Distance from Karachi: 1212 km\n\nIn 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul and followed it by conquests within the Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab.\n\nThe Janjua clan settled in the valley when Babur, the first Mughal emperor passed through on military campaigns, according to his memoirs, the Baburnama. The grave of Raja Tatar Khan Janjua is in Khutakka (Ahmadabad), the centre of his rule. The remnants of his fort 'Akrand' still stand. The Janjua were scattered after the attack of Hari Singh Bhangi in 1760 and their descendants settled in Kattha, Ratala Rajgaan, Jaswal, Dhak, Jauharabad and Shahpur.\n\nThe Awans of the Soon Valley were also amongst those the British considered to be \"martial race\". The British recruited army heavily from Soon Valley for service in the colonial army, and as such, the Awans of this area also formed an important part of the British Indian Army, serving with distinction during World Wars I and II. Of all the Muslim groups recruited by the British, proportionally, the Awans produced the greatest number of recruits during the First and Second World Wars. Contemporary historians Professor Ian Talbot and Professor Tan Tai Yong have asserted that the Awans (amongst other tribes) are viewed as a martial race by not only the British, but neighbouring tribes as well. Awans occupy the highest ranks of the Pakistani Army. A village by the name of Manawan (formerly Man Awan - The heart of the Awans) is also among the notable historical villages of the valley.\n\nThe Valley has devoted its sons to Pakistan Armed forces. Notable personalities are:\n * Major General Muhammad Hussain Shaheed\n * Air Vice Martial Muhammad Sardar\n\nThe Government of Punjab constructed the road from Nurewala to Naushehra in recognition of services rendered by the Awans of Soon Valley during the First World War. Sir W.M. Hailey, the Governor of Punjab formally opened the road on April 1, 1928 - as commemorated on plaques between Khushab and Sakesar as the road enters the hills.\n\nMany inhabitants of the valley descend from tribes of Arab origin(unauthenticated information). Islamic culture and traditions are the norm. Practices include arranged marriages according to the Islamic traditions, where the wedding ceremony takes place at a mosque. The Nikah is attended by close family members, relatives, and friends of the bride and groom. Usually men and women are separated, either sitting in separate rooms or with a purdah (curtain) separating them.\n\nLuddi is a folk dance for celebratory occasions, when the music is often played on the dhol drum and shehnai oboe.\n\nLake Uchhali is a picturesque salt water lake in the southern Salt Range overlooked by mount Sakaser, the highest mountain in the Salt Range. Its brackish water means that its waters are lifeless. Lake Khabikki is also a salt water lake in the southern Salt Range. It is one kilometer wide and two kilometres long. Khabikki is also the name of a neighbouring village. These lakes attract thousands of migratory birds each year including rare white-headed ducks (Oxyura leucocephala) from Central Asia. Jahlar Lake is another serene lake in the valley, it is accessible from Nowshehra as well as from Sargodhar.\n\n\n * Naushera\n * Uchalli\n * Khura\n * Mardwal\n * Khabaki\n * Kufri\n * Anga\n * Dhadhar\n * Kalial\n * Kuradhi\n * Jabba shah fatehullah\n * Dhaka\n * Sabral\n\n\n * Sodhi Jai wali\n * Surraki\n * Chitta\n * Sodhi Bala\n * Sodhi Zareen\n * Shakar Kot\n * Uchhala\n * Jahalar\n * Ugali\n * Kotli\n * Chamraki\n * Sirhal\n * Makrumi\n\n\n * Sakesar\n * Mustafabad (Bhukki)\n * Ahmadabad\n * Tiveen\n * Manawan\n * Jhugayala\n * Amb Sharif\n * Chambal\n * Jale Wali\n * Nato Wali\n * Kalayji\n * Kathwai\n * Tarirri\n * Biakh\n * Mahorian Wala\n * Kamre wala\n\nSurraki is the highest village of soon valley\n * Akrand Fort of Janjua's (Road way & Tracking Way from Kanhati Garden).\n * Lakes: Uchalli Lake, Khabikki Lake and Jahlar Lake.\n * Waterfalls at Kufri.\n * Amb Sharif is a historical place in Hinduism.\n * Kanahti Garden, Sodhi Garden, Khabakki Jheel, Ugalisharif & Uchali Jheel, Sakesar and Daip Shareef and the hiking experiences of hills\n * Angah, an important village.\n * Sodhi village has waterfalls, a Rest House, and wild animals like Cheetah, Rabbit, Deer, Teetar (Urdu name of a bird).\n * Koradhi is famous for its Historical Madrissa, where Qari Qamar Din used to teach\n\nThe ancient pre-Islamic ancient Hindu temple, is near the Amb Shareef village, on the Sakesar mountain in the Soon Valley.

      "title": "Yasin Valley",
      "description": "Yasin (undefined Yāsīn), also known as Babaye-i-Yasen (undefined) or Worshigum (undefined Worśigūm), is a high mountain valley in the Hindu Kush mountains, in the northwestern Ghizer District in Gilgit-Baltistan, northern Pakistan. Yasin Tehsil is situated on its territory.\n\n\n\nAlthough sparsely populated, Yasin was of strategic importance because it leads to a high mountain pass, to Yarkhun in Chitral, and then to Broghol Pass, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan and into Tajikistan. Thus, Yasin could have formed an invasion route from Czarist Russia into British India.\n\nYasin was originally ruled by the Khushwakhte dynasty, a collateral line of the Mughal sultans of Delhi, which came from Khorasan (Persia). The Rajas of Yasin were great warriors and fought against the Sikhs and the Dogras of Kashmir, but this house eventually lost power.\n * c.1640 - c.1700 Shah Khuswaqt bin Mohammad Beg\n * c.1700 Shah Alam\n * c.1720 Shah Gahangir\n * c.1740 Shah `Alamgir\n * c.1750 Shah `Alam\n * c.1760 Shah Badshah\n * c.1780 - 1804 Mulk Aman              (died 1804)\n * 1804 - 1805 Kuwat Khan\n * 1805 - 1828/29 Sulayman Shah          (d. 1828/29)\n * 1829 - 1830/40 Mir Aman\n * 1841 - 1860 Ghauhar Aman (Gur Rahma) (born 1809 - d. 1860)\n * 1860 - 1880 Ghulam Muhyiuddin\n\nFrom 1880, Yasin was under the suzerainty of the Maharaja of Kashmir, initially ruled by the Mehtars (princely rulers) of Chitral, until it got its own ruler again, now also styled Mehtar, in 1892.\n\n\n * c.1892 - 1911 `Abd ar-Rahman Khan (1st time) (b. 1877 - d. 1948?)\n * 1911 - 1912 Shahid al-Agham Khan          (d. 1912)\n * 1912 - 1922 Sifat Khan Bahadur            (d. 1922)\n * 1923 - 19. `Abd ar-Rahman Khan (2nd time) (s.a.).\n\nThe primary languages of Yasin Valley are the (Khowar and Burushaski language). The Shina language is also spoken.\n\nThe majority of the people in Yasin are Ismailis, who lead their lives according to the Islamic principles more concerned with the imam of the time. Currently Aga Khan IV is the imam and spiritual leader of the Ismailis. However, other branches of both as Sunni and Shia Islam also live in Yasin.\n\nEthnically, the people of Yasin are of Burusho origin; however, there are the migrants from different parts of the country, mainly from Afghanistan.\n\nThe people of Yasin are known for their honesty, hard work and bravery.\n\nYasin is separated from the Ishkoman Valley by a high mountain pass. To reach Yasin one must take the Karakoram Highway north from Islamabad, and then turn left to reach Gupis in Ghizar. After Gupis, one continues northwest to reach the Yasin Valley.\n\nThe part of the valley where Khowar is spoken is known in the Shina language as Arinah.\n\nAdministratively, Yasin constitutes Yasin Tehsil, which is part of Ghizer District. It is further divided into four local councils: Yasin, Sultanabad, Silgan and Thoi.\n * Yasin consists of the villages of Chiliharang, Damalgan, Gindai, Noh, Morka, Atkash, Bujayot, Manichi, Thodass and Nazbar Valley. Thodass is the headquarters of this union council.\n * Sultanabad union council consists of the villages of Chumarkhan, Taus, Barkhachi, Sultanabad (Met, Huyelti), Ghojalti, Sandi, Dalsandi and Qorqolti Valley.

Here a waterfall cascades down rocky mountain side making its way through many streams and ponds among the shady palm trees.\n\n\" Legend relates that Pir Ghaib and his sister, the venerable Bibi Nani, arrived here to convert the local heathens in the early days of Islam. But the fire worshippers sent an army after the pious pair. IN the gorge of the Bolan, the siblings split; Bibi Nani went down the gorge (her purported tomb is under a bridge about 15 km downstream) while her brother fled into this arid landscape with the army in hot pursuit. At the head of the gorge, seeing that he was blocked by the rock wall, the saint prayed to almighty to be rescued. As is the wont of the Lord of all saints, He cleaved the rock to receive the holy man. And so he was known as Pir Ghaib – The Invisible Saint.Local Hindus worship Pir Ghaib as Mahadev. But, long before the Bolan gorge had rung with vedic hymns or invocations of the Pir Ghaib, travellers and traders from the Indus Valley would have stopped at this spring sacred to their own gods on the first leg of their long journey to Mesopotamian marts. As the vedic God Shivaderives from an earlier Indus Valley deity, and as the 5000 year old goddess Nania evolves into Bibi Nani or Durga, so too did the Pir Ghaib develop from an early Indus Valley god. But until the Indus script is understood we will not know which from this pantheon was celebrated for walking into rock walls.\n\n* List of waterfalls in Pakistan",

      "description": "Minar-e-Pakistan (undefined) is a national monument located in Lahore, Pakistan. The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947.\n\nThe tower reflects a blend of Mughal/Islamic and modern architecture.\n\nThe tower was designed and supervised by, Nasreddin Murat-Khan a Russian-born Pakistani architect and civil engineer. The foundation stone was laid on 23 March 1960. Construction took eight years, and was completed on 21 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs 7,058,000. The money was collected by imposing an additional tax on cinema and horse racing tickets at the demand of Akhtar Hussain, governor of West Pakistan. Today, the minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can't climb up the stairs or access the top, by means of an elevator. The parks around the monument include marble fountains and an artificial lake.\n\nThe base is about 8 metres above the ground. The tower rises about 62 metres on the base, the total height of the minar is about 70 metres above the ground. The unfolding petals of the flower-like base are 9 metres high. The diameter of the tower is about 9.75 meters. The rostrum is built of patterned tiles, and faces Badshahi Mosque. The base comprises four platforms. To symbolise the humble beginning of the freedom struggle, first platform is built with uncut stones from Taxila, second platform is made of hammer-dressed stones, whereas third platform is of chiselled stones. Polished white marble at the fourth and final platform depicts the success of the Pakistan Movement. Mr. Mukhtar Masood, a prolific writer and the then–deputy commissioner of Lahore, was one of the members of the Building Committee. Mian Abdul Khaliq and Company and services engineer Mian Abdul Ghani went on to build many other landmarks of Pakistan including the Gaddafi Stadium (also designed by Murat-Khan) and BRB Canal.\n\nAt the base, there are floral inscriptions on ten converging white marble Commemorative plaques. The inscriptions include the text of Lahore Resolution in Urdu, Bengali and English, and Delhi Resolution's text, which was passed on 9 April 1946. On different plaques, Quranic verses and 99 attributes of Allah are inscribed in Arabic calligraphy, whereas National Anthem of Pakistan in Urdu and Bengali, excerpts from the speeches of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in Urdu, Bengali and English, along with few couplets of Allama Iqbal include the other important inscriptions.\n\nMinar-e-Pakistan has served as the location for a number of rallies.\n\nTower construction was started in 1960 and it took 8 years to complete in 1968.The estimated budget to complete the great construction near Rs.70 Lakh (7 million). Money to complete this project is collected from Pakistani people as to charge 10 to 15 Rs extra tax at theater/cinema. It is the combination of Islamic as well as national culture. The tower base is shaped like a flower. The monument is covered with parks and flowers. Its location is used for political and religious events. It is also known as \"Liberty Tower of Pakistan\".\n\n\n\n\n * List of parks and gardens in Pakistan\n * List of parks and gardens in Lahore\n * List of parks and gardens in Karachi\n\n\n * https://web.archive.org/web/20070311052425/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=364\n * https://web.archive.org/web/20070109183759/http://www.lahore.com/content/section/4/45/",

      "title": "Badshahi Mosque",
      "description": "The Badshahi Mosque (Punjabi and undefined, or \"Imperial Mosque\") is a Mughal era masjid in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab, Pakistan. The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks.\n\nThe Badshahi Mosque was commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction of the mosque lasting for two years until 1673. The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the largest and most recent of the grand imperial mosques of the Mughal-era, and is the second-largest mosque in Pakistan. After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the Sikh Empire and the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.\n\nThe mosque is located adjacent to the Walled City of Lahore, Pakistan. The entrance to the mosque lies on the western side of the rectangular Hazuri Bagh, and faces the famous Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort, which is located on the eastern side of the Hazuri Bagh. The mosque is also located next to the Roshnai Gate, one of the original thirteen gates of Lahore, which is located to the southern side of the Hazuri Bagh.\n\nNear the entrance of the mosque lies the Tomb of Muhammad Iqbal, a poet widely revered in Pakistan as the founder of the Pakistan Movement which led to the creation of Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims of British India. Also located near the mosque's entrance is the tomb of Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, who is credited for playing a major role in preservation and restoration of the mosque.\n\nLahore was considered a strategic center as it protected the empire from potential invaders from the west. The city was made an imperial capital by the earlier Emperor, Akbar, who established the nearby Lahore Fort.\n\nThe sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, chose Lahore as the site for his new imperial mosque. Aurangzeb, unlike the previous emperors, was not a major patron of art and architecture and instead focused, during much of his reign, on various military conquests which added over 3 million square kilometres to the Mughal realm.\n\nThe mosque was built to commemorate military campaigns against the Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, although construction of the mosque exhausted the Mughal treasury and weakened the Mughal state. As a symbol of the mosque's importance, it was built directly across from the Lahore Fort and its Alamgiri Gate, which was concurrently built by Aurangzeb during construction of the mosque.\n\n\n\nThe mosque was commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1671, with construction overseen by the Emperor's foster brother, and Governor of Lahore, Muzaffar Hussein - also known by the name Fidai Khan Koka. Aurangzeb had the mosque built in order to commemorate his military campaigns against the Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji. After only two years of construction, the mosque was opened in 1673.\n\nOn 7 July 1799, the Sikh army of Ranjit Singh took control of Lahore. After the capture of the city, Maharaja Ranjit Singh used its vast courtyard as a stable for his army horses, and its 80 Hujras (small study rooms surrounding the courtyard) as quarters for his soldiers and as magazines for military stores. In 1818, he built a marble edifice in the Hazuri Bagh facing the mosque, known as the Hazuri Bagh Baradari, which he used as his official royal court of audience. Marble slabs for the baradari may have been plundered by the Sikhs from other monuments in Lahore.\n\nDuring the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1841, Ranjit Singh's son, Sher Singh, used the mosque's large minarets for placement of zamburahs or light guns which were used to bombard the supporters of Chand Kaur, who had taken refuge in the besieged Lahore Fort. In one of these bombardments, the fort's Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) was destroyed, but was subsequently rebuilt in the British era. During this time, Henri de La Rouche, a French cavalry officer employed in the army of Sher Singh, also used a tunnel connecting the Badshahi mosque to the Lahore fort to temporarily store gunpowder.\n\nIn 1848, the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh was built for the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh at a site immediately adjacent to the mosque after his death.\n\nIn 1849 the British seized control of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the adjoining fort continued to be used as a military garrison. The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.\n\nBecause of increasing Muslim resentment against the use of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out under the supervision of the Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.\n\nIn April 1919, after the Amritsar Massacre, a mixed Sikh, Hindu and Muslim crowd of an estimated 25,000-35,000 gathered in the mosque's courtyard in protest. A speech by Gandhi was read at the event by Khalifa Shuja-ud-Din, who would later become Speaker of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab.\n\nExtensive repairs commenced from 1939 onwards, when Sikandar Hayat Khan began raising funds for this purpose. Renovation was supervised by supervised by the architect Nawab Alam Yar Jung Bahadur. As Khan was largely credited for extensive restorations to the mosque, he was buried adjacent to the mosque in the Hazuri Bagh.\n\nRestoration works begun in 1939 continued after the Independence of Pakistan, and were completed in 1960 at a total cost of 4.8 million Rupees.\n\nOn the occasion of the 2nd Islamic Summit held at Lahore on 22 February 1974, thirty-nine heads of Muslim states offered their Friday prayers in the Badshahi Mosque, including, among others, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Muammar Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, and Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait. The prayers were led by Mawlānā Abdul Qadir Azad, the then khatib of the mosque.\n\nIn 1993, the Badshahi Mosque in a tentative list as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2000, the marble inlay in the main prayer hall was repaired. In 2008, replacement work on the red sandstone tiles on the mosque's large courtyard was begun using red sandstone imported from the original Mughal source near Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan.\n\nAs a gateway to the west, and Persia in particular, Lahore had a strong regional style which was heavily influenced by Persian architectural styles. Earlier mosques, such as the Wazir Khan Mosque, were adorned in intricate kashi kari, or Kashan style tile work, from which the Badshahi Mosque would depart. Aurangzeb chose an architectural plan similar to that of Shah Jehan's choice for the Jama Masjid in Delhi, though built the Badshahi mosque on a much larger scale. Both mosques feature red sandstone with white marble inlay, which is a departure from typical mosque design in Lahore, in which decoration is done by means of intricate tile work.\n\nEntrance to the mosque complex is via a two-storey edifice built of red sandstone which is elaborately decorated with framed and carved paneling on each of its facades. The edifice features a muqarna, an architectural feature from the Middle East that was first introduced into Mughal architecture with construction of the nearby and ornate Wazir Khan Mosque.\n\nThe mosque's full name \"Masjid Abul Zafar Muhy-ud-Din Mohammad Alamgir Badshah Ghazi\" is written in inlaid marble above the vaulted entrance. The mosque's gateway faces east towards the Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort, which was also commissioned by Aurangzeb. The massive entrance and mosque are situated on a plinth, which is ascended by a flight of 22 steps at the mosque's main gate which. The gateway itself contains several chambers which are not accessible to the public. One of the rooms is said to contain hairs from the Prophet Muhammad's, and that of his son-in-law Ali.\n\nAfter passing through the massive gate, an expansive sandstone paved courtyard spreads over an area of 276,000 square feet, and which can accommodate 100,000 worshipers when functioning as an Idgah. The courtyard is enclosed by single-aisled arcades.\n\nThe main edifice at the site was also built from red sandstone, and is decorated with white marble inlay. The prayer chamber has a central arched niche with five niches flanking it which are about one third the size of the central niche. The mosque has three marble domes, the largest of which is located in the centre of the mosque, and which is flanked by two smaller domes.\n\nBoth the interior and exterior of the mosque are decorated with elaborate white marble carved with a floral design common to Mughal art. The carvings at Badshahi mosque are considered to be uniquely fine and unsurpassed works of Mughal architecture. The chambers on each side of the main chamber contains rooms which were used for religious instruction. The mosque can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in the prayer hall.\n\nAt each of the four corners of the mosque, there are octagonal, three storey minarets made of red sandstone that are 196 ft tall, with an outer circumference of 67 feet and the inner circumference is eight and half feet. Each minaret is topped by a marble canopy. The main building of the mosque also features an additional four smaller minarets at each corner of the building.\n\n\n\n\n * Asher, Catherine B., Architecture of Mughal India: The New Cambridge History of India Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992.\n * Chugtai, M.A., Badshahi Mosque, Lahore: Lahore, 1972.\n * Gascoigne, Bamber, The Great Mughals, New York: Harper & Row, 1971.\n * Koch, Ebba, Mughal Architecture, Munich: Prestel-Verlag, 1992.\n\n*\n\n\n * Tourism in Punjab, Pakistan\n * Architecture of Lahore\n * Wazir Khan Mosque\n\n\n * Asian Historical Architecture: Badshahi Mosque\n * UNESCO Tentative Heritage List: Badshahi Mosque",

Local shopkeeper had objected to the construction of a large mosque in a congested area, so Bukhari Khan acquired a fatwa from local religious leaders in order for construction to begin.\n\nDuring Sikh rule, the mosque was seized by Sikh authorities and converted into a gurdwara, after a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib was installed in the mosque following Sikhs complaints that the Muslim call to prayer from the mosque was disturbing their religious ceremonies at a newly constructed baoli (stepped well) nearby.\n\nThe mosque was restored in the late 1820s after Fakir Azizuddin persuaded Ranjit Singh to transfer ownership back to the Muslim community. The Muslim community was required to reduce the volume of the call to prayer, and forfeited rent from the leasing of shopfronts.\n\nThe mosque was built on a plinth elevated 11 feet off of the bazaars surface, with shops occupying the ground floor beneath the mosque. The shops rents were used to pay for the mosque's upkeep. The architectural style of the mosque reflects influences of Sikh architecture from nearby Amritsar.\n\nThe staircase in front of the mosque has 16 steps, and opens up to a small courtyard measuring 65 feet by 43 feet. An ablution tank is in the centre of this courtyard. The prayer chamber measures 40 feet long, and 16 feet wide. The mosque has a gateway, which measures 21.3 metres in length and a courtyard that measures 161.5 x. The marble domes cover seven prayer chambers. Four lofty minarets stand at the four corners of the mosque, each with an outer circumference of 20 m, soaring up to 54 m.\n\nIn 2011, the Government of Punjab began a project to restore the mosque with funding from the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the United States of America. Minarets were resurfaced while the domes were re-gilded, while new marble floors were installed.\n\n* Sunehri Mosque withering away",

      "description": "Begum Shahi Mosque (undefined), officially The Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum (undefined), is an early 17th-century mosque situated in the Walled City of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The mosque was built between 1611 and 1614 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir in honour of his mother. It is Lahore's earliest surviving example of a Mughal-era mosque, and influenced construction of the larger Wazir Khan Mosque a few decades later.\n\nThe mosque has been encroached upon by several shops, and views of the mosque from the Akbari Gate of the Lahore Fort have been obstructed by illegally constructed tyre shops. In July 2016, the Walled City of Lahore Authority announced that the shops would be removed, and the mosque would also be conserved and restored.\n\nThe mosque was built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir in the honour of his mother, Begum Mariyam Zamani, who was also known as 'Maharani Jodha Bai'. The mosque likely served as the main mosque for members that attended the Mughal court.\n\nThe mosque is located inside the old Masti Gate in the Walled City of Lahore.\n\nConstruction began in 1611 and lasted until 1614. The Mosque of Mariyam Zamani was temporarily turned into a gunpowder factory by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, for which it was then known as Barudkhana Wali Masjid (\"Gunpowder Mosque\"). In 1850 the mosque was returned to the Muslims of Lahore who were able to contribute to its renovation.\n\nThe Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum represents a transitional phase of architecture, and features both Mughal influences, and influences from the earlier Pashtun Lodi Dynasty which had previously ruled the region. Short domes and wide arches represent the earlier Lodi style, while the mosque's balconies, side rooms, and embellishment are in the Mughal style.\n\nThe mosque features Lahore's first five-bay prayer chamber that would later be typical of all later Mughal mosques such as the Wazir Khan Mosque and Badshahi Mosque. The mosque's central bay is in the style of the Persian Char Taq, and is flanked by one smaller dome on either side. The mosque originally had 3 gateways, of which 2 survive.\n\nThe mosque's prayer chamber is 130.5 feet long, and 34 feet wide. The hall is divided into 5 bays, topped by three arches - the largest of which is over the central bay. The mosque also features a courtyard measuring 128 by 82 feet, which has an ablution pool for Islamic ritual washing.\n\nThe interior of the mosque features extensive Mughal fresco work, and would be the model for the elaborate and extensive frescoes at the Wazir Khan Mosque a few decades later. Most frescoes are floral in design, and calligraphy on the walls includes non-Quranic text, and is the first mosque in Lahore to feature this practice.\n\nThe mosque features inscriptions of Quranic, and non-Quranic origin. An inscription over the northern gateway features a Persian inscription which reads:\n\n\"God be thanked through whose grace, under the auspices of His Majesty, this building was completed. The founder of the edifice, the place of salvation, is the Queen Mariyam Zamani. For the completion of this edifice, which resembles paradise, I was thinking about when at last I found it in the words \"What a fine mosque!\"\"\n\nWhile the inscription over the eastern gateway reads: \"May the Conqueror of the world, King Nur-ud-Din Muhammad, shine in the world like the sun and moon, oh God!\"\n\nOver an archway on the northern end of the mosque is a final inscription which reads: \"So said the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, \"The faithful in a mosque are as fish in water!\"\"\n\nViews of the mosque have been obstructed by illegally built shops which have encroached upon the mosque. In July 2016, the Walled City of Lahore Authority announced that the shops would be removed, and the mosque conserved and restored.\n\n\n\n",

It is located in the ancient Walled City of Lahore, in Pakistan's Punjab province.\n\nNeevin Mosque is notable for its foundation 25 feet below street level. The mosque is further noted for being one of Lahore's few remaining pre-Mughal monuments.\n\nNeevin Mosque is situated within the Walled City of Lahore along a small street named Kucha Dogran. The mosque is located near the historic Lahori Gate, and is near the Chowk Matti square.\n\nWhile Lahore is widely known for its Mughal-era monuments, Naveen Mosque is believed to have been built in 1460 C.E. by the Lodi dynasty under the rule of its first king, Bahlul Lodi. The dynasty was founded in Multan in Pakistan's Punjab province, though the founders were of Pashtun extraction. The mosque is believed to have been built by Zulfiqar Khan, who served under Lahore's governor, Haybat Khan.\n\nUnlike the Badshahi Mosque, Sunehri Mosque, and Mariyam Zamani Mosque which were desecrated under Sikh rule,  Neevin Mosque remained unmolested by Sikh authorities. It also was not greatly altered in appearance under Sikh and British rule, although its minarets had to be rebuilt following an earthquake in the early 1900s.\n\nFrom the mosque's entrance on the street, visitors must descend a staircase to access the mosque's prayer hall. The mosque's unusual foundation below street level is atypical for Lahore's other mosques, although at one time there two such mosques - the other near Yakki Gate was rebuilt in the 20th century and is now at street-level. In contrast to usual mosque construction, Hindu temples are sometimes built with subterranean vaults and chambers, leading to speculation that the mosque could have possibly been built upon the remains of an earlier Hindu temple.\n\nThe mosque's prayer hall can accommodate approximately 100 worshippers, and is divided into three roughly equally-sized sections. Each section features a short dome typical of the Lodi-style, as well as an archway that opens onto the mosque's central courtyard.\n\nThe mosque is run by the local community under the leadership of an Imam.\n\n",

Her family was closely associated with the Mughal empire. Her husband Murad Khan served Emperor Jahangir as Magistrate of Bikaner, and her son Muhammad Rashid Khan, was the best archers in the kingdom, and died fighting in the service of Shah Jahan's eldest son Dara Shikoh. The Tomb of Dai Anga is known as the \"Gulabi Bagh,\" and is also located in Lahore.\n\nThe mosque was said to have been built in 1635, however, the inscription in the mosque is said to date it to 1649 Under Sikh rule, the mosque was used as a military magazine under the rule of Ranjit Singh. During the British Raj, the mosque was converted into railway administration offices.\n\nThe mosque was designed on a scaled down version of larger Mughal mosques, such as the nearby Badshahi Mosque. The mosque is fronted by an 84-foot wide courtyard, while the building itself is divided into three section. The central section is the largest and is topped by a 19-foot dome.

The mosque is said to have been built overnight, following a dispute between local Hindus and Muslims in 1917.\n\nThe mosque was built in 1917 following a dispute between local Hindus and Muslims regarding ownership of a 3 marla site after a Muslim had offered prayer on the vacant site, upsetting local Hindus. Both communities then expressed a wish to build their house of worship there. The matter was submitted to British colonial authorities, who decided to dispatch a judge to the site in order to determine to which community the disputed plot would belong. A Muslim lawyer advised his community to build a mosque at the site before the judge arrived, so that ownership of the site would be declared in their favour as British authorities had pledged not to disturb religious sites. Under the leadership of a local wrestler named Gama Pehalwan, Muslims volunteers are said to have gathered after the evening Isha prayer, in order to build the mosque. The mosque reportedly was complete by the morning Fajr prayer, and the judge then ruled in favour of the Muslim community.\n\n\n\n* List of mosques in Lahore\n\n",

      "description": "The Wazir Khan Mosque (Punjabi and undefined; Masjid Wazīr <u>Kh</u>ān) is 17th century mosque located in the city of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. The mosque was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as part of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths. Construction of Wazir Khan Mosque began in 1634 C.E., and was completed in 1641.\n\nConsidered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque, Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile work known as kashi-kari, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab, with contributions from the governments of Germany, Norway, and the United States.\n\nThe mosque is located in the Walled City of Lahore along the southern side of Lahore's Shahi Guzargah, or \"Royal Road,\" which was the traditional route traversed by Mughal nobles on their way to royal residences at the Lahore Fort. The mosque is situated approximately 260 metres west of the Delhi Gate, where the mosque's Shahi Hammam is located. The mosque also faces a town square known as Wazir Khan Chowk, and the Chitta Gate.\n\nThe mosque was commissioned by the chief physician to the Mughal Court, Hakeem Ilam-ud-din Ansari, who was widely known as Wazir Khan. Wazir Khan later became the subedar, or Viceroy of Punjab, and commissioned several monuments in Lahore. Wazir Khan owned substantial amounts of property near the Delhi Gate, and commissioned the Wazir Khan mosque in 1634 in order to enclose the tomb of Miran Badshah, an esteemed Sufi saint whose tomb now lies in the courtyard of the mosque. Prior to construction of the Wazir Khan Mosque, the site had been occupied by an older shrine to the saint.\n\nThe mosque's interior was richly embellished with frescoes that synthesize Mughal and local Punjabi decorative traditions, while the exterior of the mosque was lavishly decorated with intricate Persian-style kashi-kari tile work. Wazir Khan's mosque superseded the older Maryam Zamani Mosque as the Lahore main mosque for congregations Friday prayers.\n\nWazir Khan's mosque was part of a larger complex that included a row of shops traditionally reserved for calligraphers and bookbinders, and the town square in front of the mosque's main entrance.\n\nWazir Khan Mosque features South Asia's first example of a purpose-built Central Asian charsu bazaar, or four-axis bazaar - although in the Wazir Khan Mosque adaptation, two of the four axises are aligned as the mosque's entryway, while the other two form the Calligrapher's Bazaar.\n\nIn addition to the row of shops that formed the \"Calligrapher's Bazaar,\" the mosque also rented space to other types of merchants in the mosque's northern and eastern façades, and also ran the nearby Shahi Hammam. Revenues from these sources were meant to serve as a waqf, or endowment, for the mosque's maintenance.\n\nConstruction of the mosque began under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in either 1634 or 1635, and was completed in approximately seven years. In the late 1880s, John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard Kipling, wrote about the mosque and its decorative elements in the former Journal of Indian Art. The British scholar Fred Henry Andrews noted in 1903 that the mosque had fallen into disrepair.\n\nThe mosque is built on an elevated plinth, with the main portal opening onto the Wazir Khan Chowk. The outer perimeter of the Wazir Khan Mosque measures 279 ft by 159 ft, with the long axis parallel to the Shahi Guzargah. It was built with bricks laid in kankad lime.\n\nWazir Khan mosque is renowned for its elaborate embellishment in a style which draws from the decorative traditions from several regions. While other monuments in Lahore from the Shah Jahan period feature intricate kashi-kari tile work, none match the enormous scale of the Wazir Khan Mosque.\n\nBricks facing the mosque's exterior are richly embellished with the Persian-style title work known as kashi-kari. Façades facing the inner courtyard are richly embellished with motifs and palette which display strong influences from 17th century Persia. Persian-style colours used include lajvard (cobalt blue), firozi (cerulean), white, green, orange, yellow and purple, while Persian-influenced motifs include star-shaped flowers and grapevines. The mosque also contains motifs of cypress trees, and is the first Mughal monument to have borrowed this motif from Persia.\n\nThe façade of the entry portal facing Wazir Khan Chowk is decorated with elaborate tile work and calligraphy that includes verses of the Quran, verses of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, prayers for the Prophet, and calligraphic insignias. Above the iwan entrance to the main prayer hall are verses from the Quran's surah Al-Baqara written by the calligraphist Haji Yousaf Kashmiri.\n\nUnlike the contemporary Shah Jahan Mosque in Sindh, the interior walls of Wazir Khan Mosque are plastered and adorned with highly detailed buon frescoes The interior decorative style is unique for Mughal-era mosques, as it combines imperial Mughal elements with local Punjabi decorative styles. The main prayer hall contains a square pavilion over which the mosque's largest dome rests - a Persian form known as Char Taq. The underside of the dome feature frescoes depicting trees in pairs, pitchers of wine, and platters of fruit, which are an allusion to the Islamic concept of Paradise.\n\nThe arched niche at the mosque's entrance facing Wazir Khan Chowk is richly decorated with floral motifs, and features one of Lahore's first examples of a muqarna - an architectural element found at the Alhambra in Spain, as well as on several imperial mosques in Iran. The low domes over the prayer hall reflect the style of the earlier Lodi dynasty, which ruled Lahore prior to the Mughal era.\n\n\n\nEntry into Wazir Khan Mosque is through a large Timurid-style Iwan over a smaller portal which faces the Wazir Khan Chowk. The iwan is flanked by two projecting balconies. Above the iwan is the Arabic Islamic declaration of faith is written in intricate tilework. The panels flanking the iwan contain Persian quatrains written by the calligraphist Muhammad Ali, who was a disciple of the Sufi saint Mian Mir. The panel on the right of the iwan reads: \"To all who turn towards the Qibla in prayer, may this door remain wide open with prosperity till the day of resurrection.\"\n\nWhile the panel to the left of the iwan reads: \"Tillers! Everything we sow in this world we will reap in the next. Lay a good foundation in this life, for everyone must pass through this gate to Paradise.\"\n\nEntry to through the small portal leads into a covered octagonal chamber which lies in the centre of the mosque's \"Calligrapher's Bazaar.\" The octagonal chamber lies in the centre of what is the first example of the Central Asian charsu bazaar concept, or four-axis bazaar, to be introduced into South Asia. Two of the four axes are aligned as the Calligrapher's Bazaar, while the other two align in a straight line from the mosque's entry portal, to the centre of the main prayer hall.\n\nPassage through the portal and octagonal chamber leads into the mosque's central courtyard. The courtyard measures approximately 160 feet by 130 feet, and features high arched galleries surrounding a central brick paved courtyard - a typical feature of imperial Persian mosques in Iran.\n\nThe mosque's courtyard contains a pool used for the Islamic ritual washing, wudu that measures 35 feet by 35 feet. The courtyard features a subterranean crypt which contains the tomb of the 14th century Sufi saint Syed Muhammad Ishaq Gazruni, also known by the name Miran Badshah.\n\nThe courtyard is flanked on four sides by 32 khanas, or small study cloisters for religious scholars. The mosque's four 107 foot tall minarets are located in each corner of the courtyard.\n\nThe mosque's prayer hall lies at the westernmost portion of the site, and is approximately 130 feet long and 42 feet wide. It is divided into five sections aligned into a single long aisle running north to south, similar to the prayer hall at the older Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum.\n\nThe central section of the prayer hall is topped by a 31 foot tall dome with a diameter of 23 feet resting upon four arches that form a square pavilion - a Persian architectural form known as a Char Taq. The remaining compartment in the prayer hall are topped by a 21 foot tall dome with a diameter of 19 feet, built in a style similar to that of the earlier Lodi dynasty. The northernmost and southernmost compartments also contain small cells which house spiral staircases that lead to the rooftop.\n\nWalls of the prayer hall's interior are also decorated with calligraphy in both Arabic and Persian. Each wall is divided further, and contain unique mosaic designs. The acoustic properties of the dome allow for the imam's sermon to be projected across the mosque's courtyard.\n\nThe mosque complex is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab. In 1993 the site was added to UNESCO's tentative list for world heritage site status. In 2004, the Government of Punjab embarked on conservations and restoration efforts for the mosque. In 2007, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture partnered with the Government of Punjab to restore the monument, and in 2009 began a two year long in-depth survey of the mosque as part of a larger effort to restore the Walled City of Lahore. In 2015, the site was mapped in 3D through a partnership between the Lahore University of Management Sciences and the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nRestoration works at Wazir Khan Mosque began in 2004.\n\nIn 2012, the Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project—the Shahi Guzargah Project was launched by the Government of Punjab and the Aga Khan Trust for culture which restored a section of Shahi Guzargah between the mosque and Delhi Gate. The project was completed in 2015 with support from the governments of Norway and the United States of America.\n\nPrior to completion of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.\n\n\n\n* Floral Decorations in Mughal Buildings\n\n\n * Badshahi Mosque\n * Shah Jahan Mosque\n * Mosques of Lahore\n * Walled City of Lahore\n * Islamic Architecture\n * Mughal architecture\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n * Lahore Photos and History\n * Reading Masjid Wazir Khan, by Kamil Khan Mumtaz",

      "description": "Moti Masjid (Punjabi, undefined), one of the \"Pearl Mosques\", is a 17th-century religious building located inside the Lahore Fort, Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is a small, white marble structure built by Mughal emperor Jahangir and modified by the architects of Shah Jahan, and is among his prominent extensions (such as Sheesh Mahal and Naulakha pavilion) to the Lahore Fort Complex. The mosque is located on the western side of Lahore Fort, closer to Alamgiri Gate, the main entrance.\n\nMoti in Urdu language means pearl, which designates a perceived preciousness to the religious structure. It was an established practice among Mughal emperors to name the mosques after generic names for gemstones. Other such examples are Mina Masjid (Gem Mosque) and Nagina Masjid (Jewel Mosque), both located in Agra Fort and completed in 1637 under Shah Jahan's reign. The mosque, built between 1630–35, is the first among the \"pearl\" named named mosques, the others built by Shah Jahan in Agra Fort (1647–53), and his son Aurangzeb in the Red Fort (1659–60).\n\nAfter the demise of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was converted into a Sikh temple and renamed Moti Mandir during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh's Sikh Confederacy (1716—99). Later, Ranjit Singh also used the building for the state treasury. When the British took over Punjab in 1849, they discovered precious stones wrapped in bits of rags and placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory. The building was later revived to its former status, and the religious relics were conserved at the nearby Badshahi Mosque.\n\nThe structure, located in the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam quadrangle, is typical of Mughal architecture of Shah Jahan's times. It is completely built of white marble that was brought from Makrana The façade is composed of cusped arches and engaged baluster columns with smooth and fine contours. The mosque has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain with the exception of ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.\n\n\n\n\n * List of mosques in Pakistan\n * Badshahi Mosque\n * Naulakha pavilion\n * Shalimar Gardens\n * Sheesh Mahal\n * Walled City of Lahore\n\n\n * Asher, Catherine E G (1992) Architecture of Mughal India.

      "description": "The Oonchi Mosque, or Oonchi Masjid (Punjabi, undefined, \"High Mosque\") is a Mughal-era mosque located along the Hakiman Bazaar, near the Bhati Gate which leads into the Walled City of Lahore, in Pakistan. The mosque may date from the reign of the Emperor Akbar. It has been extensively renovated throughout its history, resulting in little of the original mosque's decorative elements being preserved.\n\nThe mosque's name means \"High Mosque,\" and refers to the fact that the mosque was built upon a high platform. Unlike the grand Mughal mosques such as Wazir Khan Mosque and Badshahi Masjid, no inscription exists which signifies the year of the mosque's construction.\n\nThe mosque is often said to date from the reign of Akbar, however, evidence also suggest that the mosque may have been built later, during the reign of Aurangzeb.\n\nIt is said that the spiritual master of the great Punjabi poet and Sufi saint, Baba Bulleh Shah, Shah Inayat Qadiri, was Imam of the mosque. Mulla Abdul Qadir Badayuni mentions in his writing the mosque as a platform during the reign of Akbar.\n\nThe mosque has been ascribed to a mashki - a water carrier. A tughra was once located on the mosque's outer gate which read:\n\n\"What a fine new doorway of the mosque is this! Before whose arch everybody bows his head! When it was built the architect of reason said, This is the gate to the eternal Paradise.\"\n\nThe mosque features three archways and a small ablution pool for the performance of the Islamic ritual washing. Two niches along the mosque's western wall bear Quranic verses, while a third bears the name of Abul Fateh Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar Badshah Ghazi.\n\n\n * Lahore\n * Mosques of Lahore\n * Walled City of Lahore\n * Islamic Architecture\n * Mughal architecture\n\n",

      "description": "Masjid Shaheed Ganj or Shahidganj Mosque (undefined) was located in Naulakha Bazaar area of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The mosque was originally named Abdullah Khan Masjid.\n\n\n\nAbdullah Khan Mosque was built by Abdullah Khan during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Abdullah Khan was a cook of Prince Dara Shikoh, elder son of Shah Jahan, in 1653 AD, who rose up to the position of kotwal (Chief police officer) of Lahore for his services. It was completed in 1134 AH or 1722 AD by the Falak Beg Khan. According to the deed, Sheikh Din Mohammad and his descendants were appointed its mutawallī (trustee).\n\nThere was a public square near the mosque, where criminals were punished during the tenure of Nawab Zakaria Khan, a Mughal governor of the Punjab in the 18th century. Taru Singh, a man who provided assistance for the Sikhs fighting the Mughals, was tortured, and was scalped. After that incident, the Sikhs officially declared Taru Singh as a martyr and named the public square as the Shaheed Ganj (Martyr Square). In 1762, the Bhangi Sikh Sardar army conquered Lahore and occupied the mosque, together with the public square. The Muslims were not allowed to enter and pray, although the Sikhs were given the right to pray. The Sikhs built a gurdwara (Sikh temple), known as Gurudwara Shaheed Ganj Bhai Taru Singh, in the courtyard and used the mosque building to house the Sikh priests.\n\nAfter British colonial occupation of the Punjab in 1849, Shaheedganj Mosque became an issue between the Muslims and the Sikhs. The Muslims kept on protesting against the Sikh occupation of the Shaheed Ganj Mosque. On April 17, 1850, Nur Ahmad, a resident of Lahore, claimed to be a mutawallī (trustee) of the mosque and filed a case in Punjab High Court. Nur Ahmad filed several suits between 1853 and 1883 to recover the Shaheed Ganj Mosque, but courts maintained the status quo.\n\nOn 29 June 1935, the Sikh announced that they would demolish the Shaheed Ganj Mosque. Several thousand Muslims assembled in front of the mosque to protect it and Anjuman-i Tahaffuz-i Masjid Shahidganj (Organization for the protection of the Shaheedgunj Mosque) was formed. Sir Herbert Emerson, the Governor of the Punjab, tried to negotiate to find mutually acceptable solution. But, on the night of 7 July 1935 the Sikhs demolished the mosque, minutes of British India Privy Council say \"by or with the connivance of its Sikh custodians\", leading to riots and disorder in Lahore. The news shocked the Muslim community of Lahore which expected a peaceful solution. The British authorities imposed a curfew in the city and the situation was controlled.\n\nHaji Hafiz Pir Syed Jamaat Ali Shah ( 1834–1951) born in Alipur Sharif Dist, Sialkot, Pakistan and mass leader of traditional Muslims of south Asia through All India Sunni Conference led a movement Shaheed Ganj Mosque movement. After the demolition of the mosque the Muslims held a public meetings on 19–20 July at the Badshahi mosque, and marched directly on the Shaheedganj mosque. Police opened fire on the crowd on 20 July. The Muslims finally dispersed on 21 July, after more than a dozen had died from police gunfire.\n\nThe judgement of Bombay High Court on 2 May 1940 on 'Masjid Shahid Ganj Mosque vs Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak' recognized the building as a Mosque but maintained that the Statute of limitations has passed since the property has been occupied by the Sikhs for more than 170 years.\n\nThe mosque consisted of three domes and five arches. It had a projecting mehrab (niche), facing toward the Mecca as in all the mosques, in the centre of the west wall where the Imam leads the prayers. The mosque had a courtyard and an orchard of fruit trees.\n\n\n * Shahidganj Mosque Issue and the Muslims Response: 1935-1936\n * Lessons for Ayodhya from Lahore gurdwara\n * 1940 verdict in Lahore gurdwara case may play key role in deciding Ayodhya dispute\n * Shaheed Ganj Mosque\n * Mosque and gurdwara face off at Naulakha\n * Tahrik-i Masjid-i Shahid Ganj\n * Don’t revive Shaheed Ganj issue\n * Shaheed Gunj Masjid Map\n * The story of the Shahidganj Mosque in Lahore\n * Lahore’s Gurdwara Shahid Ganj: Lesson for Ayodhya\n * \n * Masjid Shahid Ganj and Historical Conflict c. 1935\n * Ayodhya verdict may be like Lahore judgment\n * Muslim Political Discourse in Postcolonial India",

      "title": "Data Darbar",
      "description": "Data Darbar (also spelt Data Durbar; undefined), located in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan is the largest Sufi shrine in South Asia. It was built to house the remains of the Muslim mystic, Abul Hassan Ali Hujwiri, commonly known as Data Ganj Baksh, who is believed to have lived on the site in the 11th century CE. The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore, and attracts up to one million visitors to its annual urs festival.\n\nThe shrine is located near the Bhati Gate of the Walled City of Lahore.\n\nThe shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a larger shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri during the Mughal period. The shrine complex was expanded in the 19th century, and Hujwiri's mosque rebuilt. The shrine came under Pakistani government control as part of the Auquf Ordinance of 1960, with the official aim of preventing shrine caretakers throughout the country from financially exploiting devotees. The shrine was greatly expanded in the 1980s under the rule of military dictator Zia ul-Haq, during which time the shrine became the largest in South Asia. Offices for NGOs, a library, madrasa, police station, carpark, and offices were all added under his regime. Designated spaces for musical performances, and new free kitchen were also added during that time. New markets have emerged around the site since its massive expansion.\n\nSince 1965, the mehfil-e-sama, a 2-day qawwali music festival, had been held adjacent to the shrine, which in 1992 shifted to a nearby school.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, two suicide bombers attacked the shrine. At least 50 people were killed, and 200 others were hurt in the blasts. On 8 May, 2019, another blast at the same site killed twelve people included police officials Saddam Hussain, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Muhammad Sohail, Head Constable Gulzar Ahmad, Constable Muhammad Saleem, and security guard Rafaqat Ali near the entrance gate for female visitors.\n\nThe shrine of Hujwiri is housed in a Mughal era tomb crafted of carved white marble. The tomb is surrounded by a massive marble courtyard, while a new educational institution at the shrine complex utilizes modernist architecture.\n\nThe site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore. The shrine has emerged a major economic, political, and social centre in Lahore, and is one of the only places in Lahore where the extremely rich and extremely poor share space together.\n\nIt is widely believed among devotees that the saint interred at the shrine is the supreme authority over all Sufi saints in the Indian subcontinent, and that no new Sufi saint could immigrate to the subcontinent without obtaining permission from the spirit of Hujwiri.\n\nFollowing the establishment of a shrine dedicated to Hujwiri, his tomb was visited by Muslims and non-Muslims in search of his blessings. Illustrious figures such as Baba Farid, Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya, Dara Shikoh, and Allama Iqbal all paid obeisance to the shrine, and pledged allegiance to Hujwiri. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was a frequent visitor to the shrine.\n\nHujwiri's teachings were critical of practices associated with South Asian Islam, such as the use of drugs, and dancing. He also taught that Sufi saints were themselves still obliged to the demands of Islam, and so is revered by reformist Muslims who are critical of Sufi practice, as well as traditionalist Muslims who revere Sufi shrines.\n\nQawwali performances are regularly held at the shrine. On special occasions, the shrine is decorated with lights, dinner is prepared for thousands of visitors, who also partake in dance while musicians play Sufi music for hours. At the boundary of the shrine, Muslim faithfuls recite the Qur'an, and pay tributes to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe shrine provides a wide array of social services which have made it a popular hub for impoverished residents. In a custom that is 1,000 years old, up to 50,000 visitors per day are offered free food at the shrine. Patrons facing personal difficulties frequently donate money or labour to the shrine's free-kitchen fund, in line with Islam's emphasis on feeding the poor. The shrine also provides for students' education in nearby schools, and helps fund local hospitals as part of its social mission.\n\nThe shrine remains open at all hours, and welcomes visitors who freely enter the complex. The shrine is visited by approximately 30,000 to 60,000 visitors on a daily basis, though the number can double on religious holidays, and on Thursdays - the traditional night for visiting shrines. Approximately 1,000,000 devotees visit the shrine during its annual urs festival.\n\nThe shrine is served by the Bhatti Chowk station of the Lahore Metrobus.\n\nThe shrine is managed as part of an Auqaf foundation as part of the Auqaf Ordinance of 1960. The shrine is managed by approximately 200 full-time workers, excluding security services. The shrine produces the most revenue for the Auqaf board out of all the some 400 shrines under its control in Punjab province, and contributes approximately 33% of the board's revenue. The shrine collects 4 times more income than is spent on the shrine's upkeep. Considered to be the centre of all shrines in Punjab, religious practices and sermons are subject to more government regulation than at other shrines in Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n * List of mausolea and shrines in Pakistan\n * Sufism\n\n\n * Data Darbar Web Site\n * Fateh Qaloob A Research Book About Data Darbar and Data Ganj Bakhsh\n * Information about the complex\n * Photos of the Data Darbar complex\n * Details about the construction",

In 2006, the temple became a centre of controversy due to media reports on its demolition which later turned out incorrect.\n\nRavi Road is the main Entrance of Lahore from Shahdra, Sheikhupura, Gujranwala & Lahore Ring Road by Niazi Chowk (Batti Chowk), This temple managed and maintained by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (EPTB).\n\nThe Evacuee Trust Property Board had previously allocated a sum of Rs 1.2 million in January 2005 for the renovation and extension of Krishna Mandir. The temple had been badly damaged in clashes that took place after the demolition of the Babri Mosque in India in the 1990s. The website of the Minorities Affairs Division of the Pakistan government states that the tender for the renovation and extension of the temple was awarded on March 31, 2005 and over half of the work had been completed by June 30, 2005. The temple was to be entirely restored by June 2006.\n\nOn 28 May 2006, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that the temple was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-storied commercial building. When Dawn reporters attempted to take photographs of the alleged site, they were asked to leave by representatives of the developer, who denied claims of a Hindu temple having existed at the site. EPTB officials reportedly concealed the fact that the structure had been a temple from the chairman to obtain his approval to allow the developer to demolish the structure.\n\nMumbai-based Daily News & Analysis released reports claiming that the priest of the demolished temple, Kashi Ram, many opposition members of the National Assembly belonging to the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League, had attempted to block the demolition by moving a motion in Parliament. However, influential members of the ruling party considered close to the builders, in cooperation with EPTB chairman, Lt Gen Zulfiqar Ali Khan, blocked the efforts and got the temple demolished.\n\nSeveral political parties in Pakistan were reported to have objected to the alleged demolition, such as the Pakistan People's party and the Pakistani Muslim League-N. They reportedly moved a motion against the destruction, saying such an act could have a bearing on Pakistan's relations with neighboring countries.\n\nA firm of lawyers representing the Hindu minority approached the Lahore High Court seeking a directive to the builders to stop the construction of the commercial plaza and reconstruct the temple at the site. The petitioners maintained that the demolition violated section 295 of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibiting the destruction of places of worship.\n\nNews of the demolition also evoked strong condemnation from in India from minority bodies and political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, as well as Muslim advocacy political parties such as the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat. Amid growing condemnation of the demolition of the only temple in Lahore, the Indian government said on June 2006 that it has ‘taken up’ the matter with the Pakistan High Commission.\n\nOn 15 June 2006, the Foreign Office of Pakistan denied reports of the demolition as \"incorrect and baseless\", and confirmed that the temple is safe. It pointed out that the property that was demolished was several kilometers away from the temple. Ejazul Haq, Minister for Religious Affairs, said that the temple is in \"perfect condition\". He responded to remarks from BJP leader L.K. Advani that minorities in Pakistan do not have religious freedom, by inviting Advani to \"visit Lahore and pray at the temple\".\n\nOm Prakash Narayan, secretary general of the Pakistan Minority Welfare Council and a Hindu, had moved the Lahore High Court on 16 June to stop construction on the website, and the court issued a stay order and requested the Lahore Development Authority to provide information on the history of the site. By June 30, 2006, Narayan had withdrawn his writ, saying the temple was intact and he had filed the petition because of a misunderstanding. Narayan was reported as saying: \"…after visiting the place and being told by the locals that there was no temple where the plaza was being constructed, I decided to file an application in the court to withdraw my petition against the federal secretary of Religious Affairs and Evacuee Property Trust Board (ETPB) chairman.\" Narayan criticized remarks by BJP leaders as misleading and accused them of attempting to damage India-Pakistan relations.\n\nThe Pakistan Hindu Council confirmed that no Krishna temple had been demolished in Lahore.\n\n\n * Hinduism in Pakistan\n * Evacuee Trust Property Board\n * Lava temple, Lahore fort\n * Valmiki Mandir, Lahore\n * Temples in Lahore\n * Hinglaj Mata\n * Katasraj temple\n * Multan Sun Temple\n * Prahladpuri Temple, Multan\n * Sadh Belo\n * Shivaharkaray\n * Shiv Mandir, Umerkot\n * Shri Varun Dev Mandir\n * Tilla Jogian",

      "description": "The Lahore Fort (Punjabi and undefined: Shahi Qila, or \"Royal Fort\"), is a citadel in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The fortress is located at the northern end of walled city Lahore, and spreads over an area greater than 20 hectares. It contains 21 notable monuments, some of which date to the era of Emperor Akbar. The Lahore Fort is notable for having been almost entirely rebuilt in the 17th century, when the Mughal Empire was at the height of its splendour and opulence.\n\nThough the site of the Lahore Fort has been inhabited for millennia, the first record of a fortified structure at the site was in regard to an 11th-century mud-brick fort. The foundations of the modern Lahore Fort date to 1566 during the reign of Emperor Akbar, who bestowed the fort with a syncretic architectural style that featured both Islamic and Hindu motifs. Additions from the Shah Jahan period are characterized by luxurious marble with inlaid Persian floral designs, while the fort's grand and iconic Alamgiri Gate was constructed by the last of the Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, and faces the renowned Badshahi Mosque.\n\nAnd after the rise of the Maratha Empire leading to the fall of the Mughal Empire, the Lahore Fort was used as the residence of Emperor Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire. The fort then passed to British colonialists after they annexed Punjab following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. In 1981, the fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its \"outstanding repertoire\" of Mughal monuments dating from the era when the empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith.\n\nThe fort is located in the northern part of Lahore's old walled city. The fort's Alamgiri gate is part of an ensemble of buildings, which along with the Badshahi Mosque, Roshnai Gate, and Samadhi of Ranjit Singh, form a quadrangle around the Hazuri Bagh. The Minar-e-Pakistan and Iqbal Park are adjacent to the northern boundary of the fort.\n\n\n\nThough the site is known to have been inhabited for millennia, the origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths.\n\nThe first historical reference to a fort at the site is from the 11th century during the rule of Mahmud of Ghazni. The fort was made of mud, and was destroyed in 1241 by the Mongols during their invasion of Lahore. A new fort was constructed in 1267 at the site by Sultan Balban of the Turkic Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The re-built fort was destroyed in 1398 by the invading forces of Timur, only to be rebuilt by Mubarak Shah Sayyid in 1421, In the 1430s, the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of Kabul. and remained under the control of the Pashtun sultans of the Lodi dynasty until Lahore was captured by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1526.\n\n\n\nThe present design and structure of the fort traces its origins to 1575, when the Mughal Emperor Akbar occupied the site as a post to guard the northwest frontier of the empire. The strategic location of Lahore, between the Mughal territories and the strongholds of Kabul, Multan, and Kashmir necessitated the dismantling of the old mud-fort and fortification with solid brick masonry. Lofty palaces were built over time, along with lush gardens. Notable Akbar period structures included the Doulat Khana-e-Khas-o-Am, Jharoka-e-Darshan, and Akbari Gate. Many Akbari structures were modified or replaced by subsequent rulers.\n\nEmperor Jahangir first mentions his alterations to the fort in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana. Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling. British visitors to the fort noted Christian iconography during the Jahangir period, with paintings of the Madonna and Jesus found in the fort complex. In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.\n\nJahangir bestowed the massive Picture Wall, a 1450 ft by 50 ft wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile, faience mosaics, and frescoes. On the spandrels of the large arched panels below Jahangir’s Khwabgah (the Imperial Bedchamber) are azdahas or winged dragons from ancient Persian mythology, cup-bearing angel figures herons, cranes and other flying birds. Many of the scenes displayed on this ‘Picture Wall’ illustrate the court life of the Mughal sovereigns, their sports and their pastimes. One of the finest panels shows four horsemen playing the noble game of chaughan, nowadays known as polo. Most prominent are those relating to elephant fights, which were one of the favourite recreations of the Mughal court.\n\nThe Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum was built adjacent to the forts of eastern walls during the reign of Jahangir. While the mosque likely served as a Friday congregational mosque for members of the Royal Court, it was not financed by Jahangir, although it likely required his approval.\n\nShah Jahan's first contribution to the fort commenced in the year of his coronation, 1628, and continued until 1645. Shah Jahan first ordered the construction of the Diwan-i-Aam in the style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall. Though construction of the Shah Burj commenced under Jahangir, Shah Jahan was displeased with its design and appointed Asif Khan to oversee reconstruction. Shah Jahan's Shah Burj forms a quadrangle with the famous Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha Pavilion. Both are attributed to Shah Jahan, although the Naulakha Pavilion may be a later addition possibly from the Sikh era. The white marble Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, also dates from the Shah Jahan period.\n\nEmperor Aurangzeb, built the Alamgiri Gate, whose semi-circular towers and domed pavilions are a widely recognised symbol of Lahore that was once featured on Pakistani currency.\n\nThe Mughals lost the fort to the Afghan Durranis, who in turn briefly lost the fort to Maratha forces before being recaptured by the Durranis. The fort was then captured by the Bhangi Misl - one of the 12 Sikh Misls of Punjab that ruled Lahore from 1767 until 1799. The fort fell to the army of Ranjit Singh, who took Lahore from the Bhangi Misl in 1799. Maharaja Duleep Singh was born at the fort's Jind Kaur Haveli in 1838. Duleep Singh had signed the Treaty of Bhyroval in 1847 that brought the Sikh empire to an effective end. The fort and the city had remained under the control of Ranjit Singh's family until the fall of the Sikh empire in 1849.\n\nDuring their occupation of the fort, the Sikhs repurposed portions of the fort for their own use. Ranjit Singh used the fort's Summer Palace as his own residence. The Sehdari pavilion, or \"Three-doored\" pavilion, was added to the fort during Sikh rule. The fort's Naag Temple was also constructed during Sikh rule, while the Mai Jindan Haveli was extensively modified during Sikh rule. The fort's Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Ranjit Singh, Sher Singh bombarded the fort in his fight against Chand Kaur.\n\nExcavations in 1959 in front of Diwan-i-Am led to the discovery of a gold coin dated 1025 CE belonging to Mahmud Ghaznavi. The coin was unearthed at the depth of 25 ft from the lawn. The cultural layers were continuous to the depth of 15 ft indicating that the fort was inhabited by people even before his conquest.\n\nWhile relaying the deteriorated floor of Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed belonging to the British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt bricks and pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the hallmark of Mughals.\n\nThe fort is divided into two sections: first the administrative section, which is well connected with main entrances, and includes gardens and Diwan-e-Khas for royal audiences. The second, a private and concealed residential section is divided into courts in the north and accessible through elephant gate. It also contains Sheesh Mahal, spacious bedrooms and small gardens. The exterior walls are decorated with blue Persian Kashi tiles. The original entrance faces the Maryam Zamani Mosque and the larger Alamgiri gate opens towards Hazuri Bagh through the majestic Badshahi mosque. Influence of Hindu architecture is seen in the zoomorphic corbels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naulakha Pavilion is an iconic sight of the Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period that is made of prominent white marble, and known for its distinctive curvilinear roof. It cost around 900,000 rupees, an exorbitant amount at the time. The structure derives its name from the Urdu word for 900,000, Naulakha.\n\nThe Naulakha pavilion served as a personal chamber and was located to the west of the Sheesh Mahal, in the northern section of the fort. The pavilion served as inspiration for Rudyard Kipling, who named his Vermont home Naulakha in honour of the pavilion.\n\nThe structure was originally inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions at the time of its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a Bengali style, and a baldachin from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion. The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.\n\nEmperor Jahangir ordered construction of the massive \"Picture Wall', which is considered to be the greatest artistic triumph of the Lahore Fort. Unlike the Red Fort and Agra Fort, Lahore Fort's ramparts were made of brick rather than red stone. The monumental Picture Wall is a large section of the outer wall which is exquisitely decorated with a vibrant array of glazed tile, faience mosaics, and frescoes.\n\nThe embellished wall stretches over much of the fort's northern and western walls and measures approximately 1450 ft by 50 ft. The wall contains 116 panels, which depict a myriad of subjects, including elephant fights, angels, and polo games that do not form a cohesive narrative; each can be viewed in isolation. Though begun under Jahangir, the Picture Wall was decorated throughout the 1620s, and may have been completed under the reign of his son, Shah Jahan.\n\nThe Picture Wall was badly neglected, and suffered from disrepair and damage. Conservation works at the site began in 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Walled City of Lahore Authority, which together have also restored other Lahore landmarks such as the Wazir Khan Mosque and Shahi Hammam. Detailed documentation of the wall using 3D scanner was completed in July 2016, after which conservation work would start.\n\nThe Sheesh Mahal (\"The Palace of Mirrors\"; undefined) is located within Jahangir's Shah Burj block in northern-western corner of the Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631-32 by Mirza Ghiyas Begh, the grand father of Mumtaz Mahal, and father of Nur Jahan. The ornate white marble pavilion's walls are decorated with frescoes, and are inlaid with pietra dura and complex mirror-work known as ayina kari. It is among the best known monuments of Lahore Fort, and forms the jewel in the fort's crown. The distinctive Shah Jahani style is reflected in the extensive use of white marble, and hierarchical accents of the construction.\n\nSheesh Mahal was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close aides. During the Sikh Empire, Shah Burj became Ranjit Singh's favourite place, who built a harem on top of the Sheesh Mahal. This was also the place where he would display his prized possession, the Koh-i-Noor.\n\nLocated directly beneath the Sheesh Mahal and Shah Burj quadrangle is the Summer Palace, also known as the Pari Mahal, or \"Fairy Palace.\" The palace is a labyrinth of chambers that date from the Shah Jahan period. They were used as a residence during hot weather months, as they were cooled by effective ventilation systems that channeled cool breezes into the palace. The palace's flooring system also helped cool the space - its floors were made of two layers that were separated by a layer of water pumped in from the Ravi River. Cool water perfumed by roses flowed through an elaborate system of 42 waterfalls and cascades throughout the palace.\n\nThe palace was historically only accessible from the overlying Sheesh Mahal, though a new entrance was built by the British near Hathi Pul, or \"Elephant Stairs.\" Its walls were decorated with intricate frescoes and marble inlay that have been severely deteriorate by layers of subsequent white-washing and centuries of dampness. Passage tunnels also exist that lead from the palace to the fort's exterior where the River Ravi once flowed, suggesting that it may have been part of an escape tunnel designed to allow occupants to flee in case of attack.\n\nThe Summer Palace remained in use during the Sikh period under the reign of Ranjit Singh. After the defeat of the Sikh empire in the Second Anglo Sikh War, it went into the hands of the British East India Company and in 1858, into the hands of the British Raj, and its appointed agents and executors.\n\nBeginning in World War 2, the Summer Palace was used as a storehouse for the British Civil Defence Department, and remained in use by Pakistan until 1973. The building's structural integrity was affected by its use as a storehouse. As of 2014, the Walled City of Lahore Authority has assumed control of the space in order to undertake restoration works with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture Following its restoration, the space will house the Lahore Fort's museum.\n\nKhilwat Khana was built by Shah Jahan in 1633 to the east of the Shah Burj Pavilion, and west of the Shah Jahan Quadrangle. It was the residence of the royal ladies of the court. The plinth and door frames are made of marble with a curvilinear roof.\n\nIn the northwest corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj (\"Black Pavilion\"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded as the ideal ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.\n\nIn the northeast corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Lal Burj (\"Red Pavilion\"). Like the nearby Kala Burj, the Lal Burj was built during the reign of Jahangir, though finished during the reign of Shah Jahan. Octagonal in shape, the Lal Burj was used as a summer pavilion. It features primary windows that opened to the north to catch cool breezes. The interior frescoes date mostly from the Sikh era, along with the entire upper level that was also added during the Sikh era.\n\nThe collection of buildings surrounding the quadrangle situated between Jahangir's Quadrangle and Khilawat Khana is referred to as Shah Jahan's Quadrangle.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khas served as a hall where the Emperor would attend to matters of the state, and where courtiers and state guests were received. The hall was site of elaborate pageantry, with processions of up to one hour long occurring before each audience session.\n\nKhwabgah was the bedroom of Shah Jahan. It was built by Shah Jahan under the supervision of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city. Five sleeping chambers are aligned in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens, and are decorated with inlaid white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.\n\nJahangir's Quadrangle occupies the northeastern corner of the fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began during the reign of Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets carved in the form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.\n\nThe Diwan-i-Aam was built by Shah Jahan in 1628 in a prominent part of the fort immediately south of Jahangir's Quadrangle. It was built style of a Chehel Sotoun - a Persian style 40-pillar public audience hall, in a style similar to the Diwan-i-Aam at the Agra Fort. The Diwan-i-Aam was used a hall for the emperors to hold audience with commoners.\n\nShah Jahan's Diwan-i-Aam was destroyed in 1841 when the son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Sher Singh bombarded the fort in his fight against Maharani Chand Kaur, the wife of Mahraja Kharak Singh. The current structure was built by the British in the 1849 after their victory against the Sikhs.\n\nKharak Singh Haveli was the haveli of Kharak Singh, the heir to Ranjit Singh. It lies in the south-east of the Jahangir's Quadrangle. It was later occupied by the British where the first and the ground floor were used as a Commandant's Quarters and godown and servants house respectively. Currently it houses the archaeological survey office.\n\nThe Jahangir Quadrangle is bordered on its northern edge by Jahangir's sleeping chambers, the Bari Khwabgah, which was largely reconstructed during the British era.\n\nThe Sikh-era Sehdari pavilion, or \"Three-doored\" pavilion, is located to the east of the Bari Khwabgah. A second Sehdari pavilion was located to the west of the Bari Khwabgah, but was subsequently destroyed during the British period. The surviving pavilion was used as an office for Faqir Syed Noor-ud-din, a trusted Governor of Ranjit Singh. The architectural style of the Sehdari pavilion is typical of the Sikh period. Frescoes decorating the pavilion portray floral designs, birds, and Hindu religious themes.\n\nThe Maktab Khana (\"Clerk's Quarters\") originally known as Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir, was constructed in 1617 under the supervision of Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir as a set of cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.\n\nThe Moti Masjid (undefined), one of the \"Pearl Mosques\", is a mosque dating from the Shah Jahan Period that is located on the western side of Lahore Fort, closer to Alamgiri Gate. It is situated in the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam. The white marble structure is among its prominent extensions (such as Sheesh Mahal and Naulakha pavilion) to the Lahore Fort Complex. Moti in Urdu language means pearl, which designates a perceived preciousness to the religious structure. It was an established practice among Mughal emperors to name the mosques after generic names for gemstones. The mosque, built between 1630–35, has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain with the exception of ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.\n\nAfter the demise of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was converted into a Sikh temple and renamed Moti Mandir during the period of the Sikh rule under Ranjit Singh's Sikh Confederacy. He later used the building for the state treasury. When the British took over Punjab in 1849, they discovered precious stones wrapped in bits of rags and placed in velvet purses scattered inside the mosque, along with other inventory.\n\n\n\nMughal Emperor Akbar built two gates. Akbari Gate was built in 1566 and now called Maseeti Gate.\n\nLocated at the western end of the fort, the Alamgiri Gate is the entrance of the Lahore Fort. It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1674. It has two semi-circular bastions where lotus petal design adorns its base. It opens to the Hazuri Bagh and faces the Badshahi Mosque. The gate is one of Lahore's most iconic monuments, and once featured on Pakistani currency.\n\nThe Naag temple is a Sikh temple built by Chand Kaur, the wife of Kharak Singh, daughter in law of the then ruling Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The temple is square in plan and built on a raised platform. Its exterior walls are covered with fresco paintings. The temple also has a water-melon shaped dome. The site is currently closed to the public in order to prevent further deterioration.\n\nMai Jindan Haveli is of unknown origins and believed to be a Mughal structure but attributed to the Mai Jindan, Chand Kaur because of the extensive additions by the Sikhs. It is a two storied building where she is alleged to have been murdered. Presently this building is site of the Sikh Gallery Museum.\n\nIn 1980, Government of Pakistan nominated the fort for inclusion in UNESCO World Heritage Site based on the criteria i, ii, and iii together with the Shalimar. In the fifth meeting session held in Sydney in October 1981, the World Heritage Site committee added both the monuments to the list.\n\nIn 2000, Pakistan sent a letter to the organization to include both the sites in List of World Heritage in Danger and sought help to restore the damaged part of the outer walls and hydraulic works of Shalamar Gardens. In April 2006, it was reported that officials had urged UNESCO to remove the name of the fort from the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of extensive restoration work funded by Norway, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and France. Restoration projects included works at the Sheesh Mahal, Alamgiri Gate, and Hazuri Bagh. After years of extensive renovation and restoration work, the fort and Shalimar Gardens were removed from the endangered list in June 2012.\n\nThough in 1990, UNESCO had ordered the Punjab Archaeological Department to bar the use of the Fort for state or private functions on account of historical significance, a wedding reception was held in violation on December 23, 2010. The Antiquities Act of 1975, which prohibits the use of historical places to protect them from damage, was violated in the following month by hosting a dinner in the Diwan-i-Khas.\n\nConservation works at the Picture Wall began in 2015 by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and Walled City of Lahore Authority. Documentation of the wall using 3D scanner was completed in July 2016, after which conservation work would start.\n\nUnder the new Local Government Act of Punjab, 2013, Shahi Qila also serves as a union council located in the Ravi Zone.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * Red Fort\n * Agra Fort\n\n\n\n*\n\n* Coloured drawings of paintings, mosaics, tiles and other architectural features in Lahore Fort in Cambridge Digital Library.

      "title": "Harappa",
      "description": "Harappa (Urdu/) is an archaeological site in Punjab, Pakistan, about 24 km west of Sahiwal. The site takes its name from a modern village located near the former course of the Ravi River which now runs 8 km in north. The current village of Harappa is less than 1 km from the ancient site. Although modern Harappa has a legacy railway station from the period of the British Raj, it is a small crossroads town of 15,000 people today.\n\nThe site of the ancient city contains the ruins of a Bronze Age fortified city, which was part of the Indus Valley Civilization centered in Sindh and the Punjab, and then the Cemetery H culture. The city is believed to have had as many as 23,500 residents and occupied about 150 ha with clay brick houses at its greatest extent during the Mature Harappan phase (2600 BC – 1900 BC), which is considered large for its time. Per archaeological convention of naming a previously unknown civilization by its first excavated site, the Indus Valley Civilization is also called the Harappan Civilization.\n\nThe ancient city of Harappa was heavily damaged under British rule, when bricks from the ruins were used as track ballast in the construction of the Lahore–Multan Railway. In 2005, a controversial amusement park scheme at the site was abandoned when builders unearthed many archaeological artifacts during the early stages of building work. A plea from the Pakistani archaeologist Mohit Prem Kumar to the Ministry of Culture resulted in a restoration of the site.\n\nThe Harappan Civilization has its earliest roots in cultures such as that of Mehrgarh, approximately 6000 BC. The two greatest cities, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, emerged circa 2600 BC along the Indus River valley in Punjab and Sindh. The civilization, with a possible writing system, urban centers, and diversified social and economic system, was rediscovered in the 1920s also after excavations at Mohenjo-daro in Sindh near Larkana, and Harappa, in west Punjab south of Lahore. A number of other sites stretching from the Himalayan foothills in east Punjab, India in the north, to Gujarat in the south and east, and to Pakistani Balochistan in the west have also been discovered and studied. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artifacts have nevertheless been found. The bricks discovered were made of red sand, clay, stones and were baked at very high temperature. As early as 1826 Harappa, located in west Punjab, attracted the attention of a British officer in India, who gets credit for preliminary excavations in Harappa.\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization was mainly an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce, the latter including trade with Sumer in southern Mesopotamia. Both Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa are generally characterized as having \"differentiated living quarters, flat-roofed brick houses, and fortified administrative or religious centers.\" Although such similarities have given rise to arguments for the existence of a standardized system of urban layout and planning, the similarities are largely due to the presence of a semi-orthogonal type of civic layout, and a comparison of the layouts of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa shows that they are in fact, arranged in a quite dissimilar fashion.\n\nThe weights and measures of the Indus Valley Civilization, on the other hand, were highly standardized, and conform to a set scale of gradations. Distinctive seals were used, among other applications, perhaps for identification of property and shipment of goods. Although copper and bronze were in use, iron was not yet employed. \"Cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were cultivated; and a number of animals, including the humped bull, were domesticated,\" as well as \"fowl for fighting\". Wheel-made pottery—some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs—has been found in profusion at all the major Indus sites. A centralized administration for each city, though not the whole civilization, has been inferred from the revealed cultural uniformity; however, it remains uncertain whether authority lay with a commercial oligarchy. Harappans had many trade routes along the Indus River that went as far as the Persian Gulf, Mesopotamia, and Egypt. Some of the most valuable things traded were carnelian and lapis lazuli.\n\nWhat is clear is that Harappan society was not entirely peaceful, with the human skeletal remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies worldwide.\n\nThe excavators of the site have proposed the following chronology of Harappa's occupation:\n * 1) Ravi Aspect of the Hakra phase, c. 3300 – 2800 BC.\n * 2) Kot Dijian (Early Harappan) phase, c. 2800 – 2600 BC.\n * 3) Harappan Phase, c. 2600 – 1900 BC.\n * 4) Transitional Phase, c. 1900 – 1800 BC.\n * 5) Late Harappan Phase, c. 1800 – 1300 BC.\n\nBy far the most exquisite and obscure artifacts unearthed to date are the small, square steatite (soapstone) seals engraved with human or animal motifs. A large number of seals have been found at such sites as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. Many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or script. Despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, and despite the use of modern cryptographic analysis, the signs remain undeciphered. It is also unknown if they reflect proto-Dravidian or other non-Vedic language(s). The ascribing of Indus Valley Civilization iconography and epigraphy to historically known cultures is extremely problematic, in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence for such claims, as well as the projection of modern South Asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area. This is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of Harappan material culture as seen from both Pakistan- and India-based scholars.\n\nIn February 2006 a school teacher in the village of Sembian-Kandiyur in Tamil Nadu discovered a stone celt (tool) with an inscription estimated to be up to 3,500 years old. Indian epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan postulated that the four signs were in the Indus script and called the find \"the greatest archaeological discovery of a century in Tamil Nadu\". Based on this evidence he goes on to suggest that the language used in the Indus Valley was of Dravidian origin. However, the absence of a Bronze Age in South India, contrasted with the knowledge of bronze making techniques in the Indus Valley cultures, calls into question the validity of this hypothesis.\n\nClay and stone tablets unearthed at Harappa, which were carbon dated 3300–3200 BC., contain trident-shaped and plant-like markings. \"It is a big question as to if we can call what we have found true writing, but we have found symbols that have similarities to what became Indus script\" said Dr. Richard Meadow of Harvard University, Director of the Harappa Archeological Research Project. This primitive writing is placed slightly earlier than primitive writings of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia, dated c.3100 BC. These markings have similarities to what later became Indus Script.\n\n\n * The earliest radiocarbon dating mentioned on the web is 2725±185 BC (uncalibrated) or 3338, 3213, 3203 BC calibrated, giving a midpoint of 3251 BC.

      "title": "Taxila",
      "description": "Taxila (from Pāli: Takkasilā, Sanskrit: तक्षशिला,, meaning \"City of Cut Stone\" or \" Rock\") is an important archaeological site of the ancient Indian subcontinent, located in the city of Taxila in Punjab, Pakistan. It lies about 32 km north-west of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, just off the famous Grand Trunk Road.\n\nAncient Taxila was situated at the pivotal junction of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. The origin of Taxila as a city goes back to c. 1000 BCE. Some ruins at Taxila date to the time of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE, followed successively by Mauryan Empire, Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Kushan Empire periods.\n\nOwing to its strategic location, Taxila has changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control. When the great ancient trade routes connecting these regions ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance and was finally destroyed by the nomadic Hunas in the 5th century. The renowned archaeologist Sir Alexander Cunningham rediscovered the ruins of Taxila in the mid-19th century. In 1980, Taxila was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2006 it was ranked as the top tourist destination in Pakistan by The Guardian newspaper.\n\nBy some accounts, the University of Ancient Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world. Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila,  in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.\n\nIn a 2010 report, Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most \"On the Verge\" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. However, significant preservation efforts have been carried out since then by the government which have resulted in the site being declared as \"well-preserved\" by different international publications. Because of the extensive preservation efforts and upkeep, the site is a popular tourist spot, attracting up to one million tourists every year.\n\nTaxila was known in Pali as Takkasilā, and in Sanskrit as तक्षशिला (Takshashila, ; \"City of Cut Stone\"). The Greeks pared the city's name down to Taxila which became the name that the Europeans were familiar with ever since the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nTakshashila can also alternately be translated to \"Rock of Taksha\" in reference to the Ramayana which states that the city was named in honour of Bharata's son and first ruler, Taksha. According to another derivation, Takshashila is related to Takshaka (Sanskrit for \"carpenter\") and is an alternate name for the Nāga, a non-Indo-Iranian people of ancient India.\n\nFaxian who had visited the city had given its name's meaning as \"Cut off Head\". With the help of a Jataka, he had interperted it to be the place where Buddha in his previous birth as Pusa or Chandaprabha cut off his head to feed a hungry lion. This tradition still persists with the area in front of Sirkap (also meaning \"cut off head\") was known in the 19th century as Babur Khana (\"House of Tiger\"), which alludes to the place where Buddha offered his head. In addition, a hill range to south of Taxila Valley is called Margala (\"cut off throat\").\n\nIn Vedic texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, it is mentioned that the Vedic philosopher Uddalaka Aruni (c. 7th century BCE) had travelled to the region of Gandhara. In later Buddhist texts, the Jatakas, it is specified that Taxila was the city where Aruni and his son Shvetaketu each had received their education.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of Taxila is in Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī, a Sanskrit grammar treatise dated to the 5th century BCE.\n\nMuch of the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, is a conversation between Vaishampayana (a pupil of the sage, Vyasa) and King Janamejaya. It is traditionally believed that the story was first recited by Vaishampayana at the behest of Vyasa during the snake sacrifice performed by Janamejaya at Takshashila. The audience also included Ugrashravas, an itinerant bard, who would later recite the story to a group of priests at an ashram in the Naimisha Forest from where the story was further disseminated. The Kuru Kingdom's heir, Parikshit (grandson of Arjuna) is said to have been enthroned at Takshashila.\n\nThe Ramayana describes Takshashila as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of Rama. Bharata, who also founded nearby Pushkalavati, installed his two sons, Taksha and Pushkala, as the rulers of the two cities.\n\nIn the Buddhist Jatakas, Taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of Gandhara and a great centre of learning with world-famous teachers. The Takkasila Jataka, more commonly known as the Telapatta Jataka, tells the tale of a prince of Benares who is told that he would become the king of Takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the yakkhinis who waylaid travellers in the forest. According to the Dipavamsa, one of Taxila's early kings was a Kshatriya named Dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons. , mentioned in the Avadanakalpalata, is another king associated with the city.\n\nIn the Jain tradition, it is said that Rishabha, the first of the Tirthankaras, visited Taxila millions of years ago. His footprints were subsequently consecrated by Bahubali who erected a throne and a dharmachakra (\"wheel of the law\") over them several miles in height and circumference.\n\n\n\nThe region around Taxila was settled by the neolithic era, with some ruins at Taxila dating to 3360 BCE. Ruins dating from the Early Harappan period around 2900 BCE have also been discovered in the Taxila area, though the area was eventually abandoned after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nThe first major settlement at Taxila was established around 1000 BCE. By 900 BCE, the city was already involved in regional commerce, as discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and Puṣkalāvatī. Taxila was sometimes ruled as part of the Gandhara kingdom (whose capital was Pushkalavati), particularly after the Achaemenid period, but Taxila sometimes formed its own independent district or city-state.\n\nTaxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient \"Royal Highway\" that connected the Mauryan capital at Pataliputra in Bihar, with ancient Peshawar, Puṣkalāvatī, and onwards towards Central Asia via Kashmir, Bactria, and Kāpiśa. Taxila thus changed hands many times over the centuries, with many empires vying for its control.\n\n\n\nArchaeological excavations show that the city may have grown significantly during the rule of the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE. In 516 BCE, Darius I embarked on a campaign to conquer Central Asia, Ariana and Bactria, before marching onto what is now Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. Emperor Darius spent the winter of 516-515 BCE in the Gandhara region surrounding Taxila, and prepared to conquer the Indus Valley, which he did in 515 BCE, after which he appointed Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean from the mouth of the Indus to the Suez. Darius then returned to Persia via the Bolan Pass. The region continued under Achaemenid suzerainty under the reign of Xerxes I, and continued under Achaemenid rule for over a century.\n\nDuring his invasion of the Indus Valley, Alexander the Great was able to gain control of Taxila in 326 BCE without a battle, as the city was surrendered by its ruler, king Omphis (Āmbhi). Greek historians accompanying Alexander described Taxila as “wealthy, prosperous, and well governed.”\n\nBy 317 BCE, the Greek satraps left by Alexander were driven out, and Taxila came under the control of Chandragupta Maurya, who turned Taxila into a regional capital. His advisor, Kautilya/Chanakya, was said to have taught at Taxila's university. Under the reign of Ashoka, Chandragupta's grandson, the city was made a great seat of Buddhist learning, though the city was home to a minor rebellion during this time.\n\nIn the 2nd century BCE, Taxila was annexed by the Indo-Greek kingdom of Bactria. Indo-Greeks built a new capital, Sirkap, on the opposite bank of the river from Taxila. During this new period of Bactrian Greek rule, several dynasties (like Antialcidas) likely ruled from the city as their capital. During lulls in Greek rule, the city managed profitably on its own, to independently control several local trade guilds, who also minted most of the city's autonomous coinage. In about the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, an Indo-Scythian king named Azilises had three mints, one of which was at Taxila, and struck coins with obverse legends in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.\n\nThe last Greek king of Taxila was overthrown by the Indo-Scythian chief Maues around 90 BCE. Gondophares, founder of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, conquered Taxila around 20 BCE, and made Taxila his capital. According to early Christian legend, Thomas the Apostle visited Gondophares IV around 46 CE, possibly at Taxila given that that city was Gondophares' capital city.\n\nIn the first century CE, the Greek Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited Taxila, which his team described as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan, similar in size to Nineveh. Inscriptions dating to 76 CE demonstrate that the city had come under Kushan rule by this time, after the city was captured from the Parthians by Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan Empire. The great Kushan ruler Kanishka later founded Sirsukh, the most recent of the ancient settlements at Taxila.\n\nIn the mid fourth century CE, the Gupta Empire occupied the territories in Eastern Gandhara, establishing a Kumaratya's post at Taxila. The City became well known for its Trade links- including Silk, Sandalwood, Horses, Cotton, Silverware, Pearls, and Spices. It is during this time that the City heavily features in Classical Indian Literature- both as a centre of Culture as well as a militarised border City.\n\nTaxila's university remained in existence during the travels of Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited Taxila around 400 CE. He wrote that Taxila's name translated as \"the Severed Head\", and was the site of a story in the life of Buddha \"where he gave his head to a man\".\n\nThe Kidarites, vassals of the Hephthalite Empire are known to have invaded Taxila in c. 450 CE. Though repelled by the Gupta Emperor Skandagupta, the city would not recover- probably on account of the strong Hunnic presence in the area, breakdown of trade as well as the three-way war between Persia, the Kidarite State, and the Huns in Western Gandhara.\n\nThe White Huns swept over Gandhāra and Punjab around 470 CE, causing widespread devastation and destruction of Taxila's famous Buddhist monasteries and stupas, a blow from which the city would never recover. From 500 CE to 540 CE, the city fell under the control of the Hunnic Empire in South Asia and languished.\n\nXuanzang visited India between 629 to 645 CE. Taxila which was desolate and half-ruined was visited by him in 630 CE, and found most of its sangharamas still ruined and desolate. Only a few monks remained there. He adds that the kingdom had become a dependency of Kashmir with the local leaders fighting amongst themselves for power. He noted that it had some time previously been a subject of Kapisa. By the ninth century, it became a dependency of the Kabul Shahis. The Turki Shahi dynasty of Kabul was replaced by the Hindu Shahi dynasty which was overthrown by Mahmud of Ghazni with the defeat of Trilochanpala.\n\n\n\nBy some accounts, Taxila was considered to be one of the earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world. Others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in that the teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.\n\nTaxila became a noted centre of learning (including the religious teachings of Buddhism) at least several centuries BCE, and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century. It has been suggested that at its height, Taxila exerted a sort of \"intellectual suzerainty\" over other centres of learning in India and its primary concern was not with elementary, but higher education. Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The ancient and the most revered scriptures, and the Eighteen Silpas or Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. Students came to Taxila from far-off places such as Kashi, Kosala and Magadha, in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo, on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there, all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects.\n\nTaxila had great influence on Hindu culture and the Sanskrit language. It is perhaps best known for its association with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, the strategist who guided Chandragupta Maurya and assisted in the founding of the Mauryan empire. Chanakya's Arthashastra (The knowledge of Economics) is said to have been composed in Taxila. The Ayurvedic healer Charaka also studied at Taxila. He also started teaching at Taxila in the later period. Pāṇini, the grammarian who codified the rules that would define Classical Sanskrit, has also been part of the community at Taxila.\n\nThe institution is significant in Buddhist tradition since it is believed that the Mahāyāna branch of Buddhism took shape there. Jīvaka, the court physician of the Magadha emperor Bimbisara who once cured the Buddha, and the Buddhism-supporting ruler of Kosala, Prasenajit, are some important personalities mentioned in Pali texts who studied at Taxila.\n\nNo external authorities like kings or local leaders subjected the scholastic activities at Taxila to their control. Each teacher formed his own institution, enjoying complete autonomy in work, teaching as many students as he liked and teaching subjects he liked without conforming to any centralised syllabus. Study terminated when the teacher was satisfied with the student's level of achievement. In general, specialisation in a subject took around eight years, though this could be lengthened or shortened in accordance with the intellectual abilities and dedication of the student in question. In most cases the \"schools\" were located within the teachers' private houses, and at times students were advised to quit their studies if they were unable to fit into the social, intellectual and moral atmosphere there.\n\nKnowledge was considered too sacred to be bartered for money, and hence any stipulation that fees ought to be paid was vigorously condemned. Financial support came from the society at large, as well as from rich merchants and wealthy parents. Though the number of students studying under a single Guru sometimes numbered in the hundreds, teachers did not deny education even if the student was poor; free boarding and lodging was provided, and students had to do manual work in the household. Paying students, such as princes, were taught during the day, while non-paying ones were taught at night. Gurudakshina was usually expected at the completion of a student's studies, but it was essentially a mere token of respect and gratitude - many times being nothing more than a turban, a pair of sandals, or an umbrella. In cases of poor students being unable to afford even that, they could approach the king, who would then step in and provide something. Not providing a poor student a means to supply his Guru's Dakshina was considered the greatest slur on a King's reputation.\n\nExaminations were treated as superfluous, and not considered part of the requirements to complete one's studies. The process of teaching was critical and thorough- unless one unit was mastered completely, the student was not allowed to proceed to the next. No convocations were held upon completion, and no written \"degrees\" were awarded, since it was believed that knowledge was its own reward. Using knowledge for earning a living or for any selfish end was considered sacrilegious.\n\nStudents arriving at Taxila usually had completed their primary education at home (until the age of eight), and their secondary education in the Ashrams (between the ages of eight and twelve), and therefore came to Taxila chiefly to reach the ends of knowledge in specific disciplines.\n\nThe sites of a number of important cities noted in ancient Indian texts were identified by scholars early in the 19th century. The lost city of Taxila, however, was not identified until later, in 1863-64. Its identification was made difficult partly due to errors in the distances recorded by Pliny in his Naturalis Historia which pointed to a location somewhere on the Haro river, two days march from the Indus. Alexander Cunningham, the founder and the first director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, noticed that this position did not agree with the descriptions provided in the itineraries of Chinese pilgrims and in particular, that of Xuanzang, the 7th-century Buddhist monk. Unlike Pliny, these sources noted that the journey to Taxila from the Indus took three days and not two. Cunningham's subsequent explorations in 1863–64 of a site at Shah-dheri convinced him that his hypothesis was correct. \"Now as Hwen Thsang, on his return to China, was accompanied by laden elephants, his three days' journey from Takhshasila [sic] to the Indus at Utakhanda, or Ohind, must necessarily have been of the same length as those of modern days, and, consequently, the site of the city must be looked for somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kâla-ka-sarâi. This site is found near Shah-dheri, just one mile to the north-east of Kâla-ka-sarâi, in the extensive ruins of a fortified city, around which I was able to trace no less than 55 stupas, of which two are as large as the great Manikyala tope, twenty eight monasteries, and nine temples.\"\n\n- Alexander Cunningham\n\nTaxila's archaeological sites lie near modern Taxila about 35 km northwest of the city of Rawalpindi. The sites were first excavated by John Marshall, who worked at Taxila over a period of twenty years from 1913.\n\nThe vast archaeological site includes neolithic remains dating to 3360 BCE, and Early Harappan remains dating to 2900–2600 BCE at Sarai Kala. Taxila, however, is most famous for ruins of several settlements, the earliest dating from around 1000 BCE. It is also known for its collection of Buddhist religious monuments, including the Dharmarajika stupa, the Jaulian monastery, and the Mohra Muradu monastery.\n\nThe main ruins of Taxila include four major cities, each belonging to a distinct time period, at three different sites. The earliest settlement at Taxila is found in the Hathial section, which yielded pottery shards that date from as early as the late 2nd millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE. The Bhir Mound ruins at the site date from the 6th century BCE, and are adjacent to Hathial. The ruins of Sirkap date to the 2nd century BCE, and were built by the region's Greco-Bactrian kings who ruled in the region following Alexander the Great's invasion of the region in 326 BCE. The third and most recent settlement is that of Sirsukh, which was built by rulers of the Kushan empire, who ruled from nearby Purushapura (modern Peshawar).\n\nTaxila was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 in particular for the ruins of the four settlement sites which \"reveal the pattern of urban evolution on the Indian subcontinent through more than five centuries\". The serial site includes a number of monuments and other historical places of note in the area besides the four settlements at Bhir, Saraikala, Sirkap, and Sirsukh. They number 18 in all:\n\n• # Khanpur Cave\n\n• # Saraikala, prehistoric mound\n\n• # Bhir Mound\n\n• # Sirkap (fortified city)\n\n• # Sirsukh (fortified ruined city)\n\n• # Dharmarajika stupa and monastery\n\n• # Khader Mohra (Akhuri)\n\n• # Kalawan group of buildings\n\n• # Giri complex of monuments\n\n• # Kunala stupa and monastery\n\n• # Jandial complex\n\n• # Lalchak and Badalpur Buddhist stuppa\n\n• # Mohra Moradu stupa and monastery\n\n• # Pippala stupa and monastery\n\n• # Jaulian stupa and monastery\n\n• # Lalchak mounds\n\n• # Buddhist remains around Bhallar stupa\n\n• # Giri Mosque and tombs\n\nIn a 2010 report, Global Heritage Fund identified Taxila as one of 12 worldwide sites most \"on the Verge\" of irreparable loss and damage, citing insufficient management, development pressure, looting, and war and conflict as primary threats. In 2017, it was announced that Thailand would assist in conservation efforts at Taxila, as well as at Buddhist sites in the Swat Valley.\n\n\n\n\n * Taxila (satrapy)\n * Harappa\n * Gandhara\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n * Explore Taxila with Google Earth on Global Heritage Network\n * Guide to Historic Taxila by Ahmad Hasan Dani in 10 chapters\n * \"Taxila\", by Jona Lendering\n * Map of Gandhara archaeological sites, from the Huntington Collection, Ohio State University (large file)\n * Taxila: An Ancient Indian University by S.

      "title": "Chauburji",
      "description": "\n\nChauburji (Punjabi and undefined, \"Four Towers\") is Mughal era monument in the city of Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. The Shah Jahan period monument previously acted as a gateway to a large garden, and was built in 1646 C.E.\n\nChauburji is located on Lahore's Multan Road, which leads southwards to Multan, and was the gateway to an extensive garden known to have existed in Mughal times. The name \"Chauburji,\" which translates as \"four towers\" was likely given by later generations, as the site as seen as a monumental gateway to an extensive garden.\n\nThe establishment of this garden is often attributed to Mughal Princess Zeb-un-Nisa, who is believed to be referenced in an inscription naming her \"Sahib-e-Zebinda Begam-e-Dauran.\" The princess was eight years old at the time of construction, so it has been suggested that the inscription may actually be in reference to her aunt, Jahanara Begum, who was a daughter of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.\n\nThe garden for which Chauburji acted as a gateway no longer exists, and the structure is now located in a grassy roundabout at the busy intersection of Lahore's Multan Road, and Bahawalpur Road. The Mughal garden is believed to have extended from Nawankot in the south, and extending towards the Lahore.\n\nFlooding from the Ravi river is believed have destroyed most of the garden during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb. No traces of the once expansive garden survive aside from the Chauburji gate.\n\nChauburji is built in a syncretic style that blends Mughal architecture, the older Timurid-style from Central Asia, and Perso-Arabic styles from the Middle East. Its distinguishing features are the minarets which greatly widen at the top - a unique feature not present anywhere in the sub-continent. Some, however, believe that there were cupolas upon these minarets which collapsed with the passage of time.\n\nThe eastern and western facades of the structure are decorated by two-storey Timurid-style iwans flanked by two levels of alcoves in a style typical of the Shah Jehan period of Mughal architecture. The building was once covered in intricate blue and green kashi kari (or Kashan-style) tile work and frescoes. The iwans are embellished with muqarnas, which were first introduced into the Mughal Empire from Persia with construction of Lahore's Wazir Khan Mosque.\n\nThe building's red brickwork is typical of the Muslim buildings of the sub-continent; the doorways and windows running through the interior corridors are examples of the living style that characterised Mughal structures. Although most of the inscriptions on Chauburjia have been lost, on the upper-most part of the construction Ayat-ul-Kursi can be seen in Arabic script in blue and worked in porcelain.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Charminar of Hyderabad, India influenced the architecture of Chauburji.\n\nDuring a severe earthquake in 1843, the north-western minaret collapsed and cracks appeared in the central arch. This has however been restored as much as was reasonably possible and the gateway now looks quite as it might have been during the time of its Mughal patroness. The restoration was carried out by the Department of Archeology in the late 1960s.\n\nChauburji is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab.\n\nThe Chauburji monument is situated along the planned route of the Orange Line of the Lahore Metro. Heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the Lahore High Court as the planned metro line will pass close to Chauburji, Shalimar Gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the Punjab Special Premises Ordinance, 1985 and Antiquity Act, 1975. In August 2016, the Court halted construction of the metro within 200 feet of any heritage site, including Chauburji in order to prevent what UNESCO termed as potentially \"irreversible damage,\" were the line to be constructed in its present form.\n\n\n\n\n * Islamic Architecture\n * Char Minar\n\n* Our Own Char Minar by Daniyal Saleem Gilani\n\n* Watch Chauburji in 3D by using Google Earth.

      "description": "Derawar Fort (undefined), is a large square fortress in Yazman Tehsil, Punjab, Pakistan. Approximately 130 km south of the city of Bahawalpur, the forty bastions of Derawar are visible for many miles in the Cholistan Desert. The walls have a perimeter of 1500 metres and stand up to thirty metres high.\n\nDerawar fort was first built in the 9th century AD by Rai Jajja Bhatti, a Hindu ruler of the Bhatti clan, as a tribute to Rawal Deoraj Bhatti, the king of Jaisalmer and Bahawalpur. The fort was initially known as Dera Rawal, and later referred to as Dera Rawar, which with the passage of time came to be pronounced Derawar, its present name.\n\nIn the 18th century, the fort was taken over by Muslim Nawabs of Bahawalpur from the Shahotra tribe. It was later rebuilt in its current form in 1732 by the Abbasi ruler Nawab Sadeq Muhammad, but in 1747 the fort slipped from their hands owing to Bahawal Khan's preoccupations at Shikarpur. Nawab Mubarak Khan took the stronghold back in 1804. 1,000 year-old catapult shells were found in the debris near a decaying wall in the fort.\n\nNawab Sadeq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V, the 12th and last ruler of Bahawalpur state, was born in the fort in 1904.\n\nThis historically significant fort presents an enormous and impressive structure in the heart of the Cholistan desert, but it is rapidly deteriorating and in need of immediate preventative measures for preservation.\n\nDerawar Fort is an important place for tourists. The off-road Cholistan Desert Jeep Rally or TDCP Cholistan Jeep Rally was recently established near the Derawar Fort in Ahmadpur East Tehsil.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n\n* Derawar Fort, The Large Square Fortress in Pakistan\n * Derawar Fort\n * ContactPakistan.com - Derawar Fort Page\n * Pictures of the Fort - PakWheels.com\n * Derawar Fort, The Large Square Fortress in Pakistan",

      "title": "Rohtas Fort",
      "description": "Rohtas Fort (Punjabi, undefined; Qila Rohtas) is a 16th-century fortress located near the city of Jhelum in the Pakistani province of Punjab.The fortress was built during the reign of Sher Shah Suri between 1541 and 1548. The fort was also designed to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of the Potohar region. The Gakhar tribes were allies of the Mughal Empire, and refused to recognize the suzerainty of Sher Shah Suri. The fort is one of the largest and most formidable in the subcontinent. Rohtas Fort was never stormed by force, and has survived remarkably intact.\n\nThe fort is known for its large defensive walls, and several monumental gateways. Rohtas Fort was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1997 for being an \"exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of Central and South Asia.\"\n\nThe fort lies eight kilometers south of the Grand Trunk Road. It is approximately 16 km NW of Jhelum, and is near the city of Dina. It is approximately 3 km from Khukha. The historic Shahrah-e-Azam road once passed adjacent to the outer northern wall of the fort.\n\nRohtas Fort was built on a hill overlooking a gorge where the Kahan river meets a seasonal stream called Parnal Khas within the  Tilla Jogian Range. The fort is about 300 ft above its surroundings. It is 2660 ft above sea level and covers an area of 12.63 acre.\n\nThe fort was commissioned by Sher Shah Suri, founder of the Sur Empire. The fort was designed to block the advances of Mughal emperor Humayun, who had been exiled to Persia following his defeat at the Battle of Kannauj. The fort occupies a strategic position between the mountainous region of Afghanistan and the plains of Punjab, and was intended to prevent the Mughal emperor from returning to India.\n\nThe fort was also designed to suppress the local Gakhar tribes of the Potohar region. The Gakhar tribes were allies of the Mughal Empire, and refused to recognize the suzerainty of Sher Shah Suri.\n\n\n\nThe origin of the fort goes back to the Sur dynasty, where emperor Sher Shah Suri ordered the court to be constructed after his victory over the Mughal emperor Humayun. Construction of the fort began in 1541. It was made primarily as a defense against the Gakkhars.\n\nThe fort was soon ceded to Mughal emperor Humayun in 1555, after the local governor, Tatar Khan Khasi, deserted the fort ahead of the Mughal army's advances.\n\nThe fort lost much of its significance as the fort's purpose of subduing pro-Mughal Gakhar tribesmen, as well as the preventing the return of Emperor Humayun, was no longer required. Further, the construction of the nearby Attock Fort in the 1580s by the Emperor Akbar better served Mughal interests. Rohtas Fort, ironically, came to serve as capital of the Gakhar tribes that it had initially been designed to subdue, and was not required as a military garrison as the local Gakhar tribes remained loyal to the Mughal crown.\n\nThe fort remained in use during the Mughal era, and was used almost continuously until 1707, though it was not popular with the Mughal rulers since it lacked large gardens and the sort of grand architecture found at Mughal-era forts, such as at the Lahore Fort. The Afsharid ruler Nadir Shah camped at the fort during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. Also the Afghan ruler Ahmed Shah Abdali had used the fort in his expeditions in the Punjab during the waning days of the Mughal empire.\n\nIn 1825, the Sikh forces of Gurmukh Singh Lamba captured the fort from the Gakhar chieftain Nur Khan. Rohtas was also thereafter used for administrative purposes by the Sikh Kingdom until its collapse by the British in 1849.\n\nRohtas Fort covers an area of 70 hectares, enclosed by 4 kilometres of walls that were bolstered by 68 bastion towers, and 12 gates. The fort roughly forms an irregularly shaped triangle, and follows the contours of the hill it was constructed on. The northwest corner of the fort is walled off from the rest of the fort by a 533 m wall. The enclosed section served as a citadel for elites and was more heavily guarded. The enclosed section is site of much of the fort's most notable remains. The fort's Langar Khani gate opens into the citadel, but is actually a trap that is in the direct line of fire from the fort's bastions.\n\nThe large fort could hold a force of up to 30,000 men.The northwest corner of the fort is walled off from the rest of the fort by a 533 m wall. The enclosed section served as a citadel for elites. Due to its location, massive walls, trap gates and 3 baolis (stepped wells), it could withstand a major siege, although it was never actually besieged. There are no palaces in the fort except for the Raja Man Singh Haveli, which is built on the highest point of the citadel. The area of the fort is 3200 canals.\n\n\n\nThe height of the outer wall varies between 10 and 18 metres, with a thickness that varies between 10 and 13 metres. The fortified walls have 68 bastions at irregular intervals, with 12 monumental gateways providing access to the inner fort. The ramparts follow the hilltop's contours.\n\nThe walls have up to 3 terraces located at different levels. Each level was connected to the other by way of a staircase. The uppermost terrace has merlon-shaped battlements from which muskets could be fired, and from which soldiers could also pour molten lead.\n\nThe wall is built in sandstone laid in lime mortar mixed with brick. The gates are in grey ashlar masonry. Some portions have been built using burnt brick.\n\nThe Rohtas Fort has the following 12 gates. All of them are built in ashlar stone.\n\n\n\nThe Sohail gate features some of the best masonry work of the Sur Empire, and was likely the ceremonial main entrance to the fort. It derives its name from a local saint named Sohail Bukhari − whose remains are interred in the south-western portion of the gate.\n\nThe gate rectangular in shape, and measures 21.34 m high, by 20.73 m wide, and with a depth of 15 m. Its central archway is 4.72 m wide, and maintains its shape throughout the gates depth. The gateway is with floral motifs, with richer decoration on the outer face.\n\nThere are seven battlements along the outer face of the Sohail gate. The gate features room in the upper portion that have windows which open towards the fort's interior. Like the outer arch there is a small window in the middle of the inner arch.\n\n\n\nThis gate links the citadel to the main fort. It is named after Shah Chandwali who refused to get his wages for working on this gate. The saint died while still on work and was buried near the gate. His shrine still stands to this day.\n\nThis gate is also a double gate. The outer gate, the entrance of which is from the citadel is 13.3 meters wide and 8.23 meters deep. The inner gate is a simple archway which is 3.66 meters wide. There are 12 gates of the fort.\n\nThe Kabuli gate derives its name from the fact that it opens towards the northwest in the general direction of Kabul. The gate now houses a visitors' information center, and a museum set up by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation.\n\nThe gate may have been built in two stages. It consists of an inner and outer gate which encloses a step-well. Its opening is 3.15 m wide, and is flanked by two bastions on either side of the opening. The gate has 5 battlements on top, and has stairs leading up to it from the outside. On the southern side of the gate is the Shahi (Royal) Mosque because of which many people also call it Shahi (Royal) Darwaza (Gate or Door).\n\nThe gate derives its name from the beautiful glazed tiles used to decorate its outer arch. These tiles are the earliest examples of this technique which was later refined in Lahore. These tiles are blue in color.\n\nAn inscription on the left side of the gate gives the date of construction of the fort. The inscription is in Persian and is translated as\n\nIn the Hijri Year 948 [1541 CE] came the exalted\n\nAt that time constructed the great fort\n\nThe emperor is Sher, with long life\n\nThere is no match to his good fortune\n\nIt was completed by Shahu Sultan \n\nLangar Khan is a double gate which is 15.25 m high, 3.5 m wide with a central arched opening. The outer arch has a small window like the Sohail Gate. The outer opening leads to a Langar Khana (Mess or Canteen).\n\nThere are two bastions on either side of the gate which have kitchen, stores and a well for water. The opening of this gate is L shaped. As soon as one enters from the outer gate one has to turn right.\n\nThis gate is 15.25 meters high and 13.8 meters wide with two bastions on either side. This gates name derives from \"Talaq\" (divorce). According to a legend, Prince Sabir Suri entered the gate and had an attack of fever which proved fatal. This was regarded as a bad omen and the name became \"Talaqi\".\n\nThe gate opens to the north and faces towards Kashmir. This gate opens into one chamber which opens into another.\n\nThis gate is named after one of Sher Shah Suri's greatest general, Khawas Khan Marwat. This was the original entrance to the Qila (Fort) because outside the gate lies the old GT Road.\n\nIt is a double gate. The outer gate is 12.8 m wide and 8 m deep. It is accessible by only one gate and also had a very fine Baoli which suggests that it was meant for the chief and his family.This gate has a bastion and a defensive wall on each side. On the bastions cannons could be deployed. The inner and outer gates are almost mirror images of each other. The top of the gate has five battlements. All of these have loopholes as well as machicolation. Unlike other gates of this Qila, the inner side of the gate has five battlements.\n\nThe inner and outer arches have sunflower motifs like the Sohail Gate. The gate also has a room which has windows opening to the inside and the outside.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that when the Gakhars refused their allegiance to Sher Shah Suri, he launched an expedition to punish them. This resulted in the capture of the Gakhar chief Sultan Sarang Khan and his daughter. Sarang Khan was then killed. His daughter was then married to Sher Shah's favourite general Khawas Khan Marwat.\n\nIt is a single gate 9.15 meter high and 6.1 meter deep. This gate faces to the village Gatali Ford (ravine) which is called also Patan Gatiali or Gatiyalian, the important point to cross the River Jhelum for the Kashmir Vally, thus the name.\n\nThis is an entrance rather than a gate. It is on the eastern side of the fort. It is about 2 meters wide. There is a bastion next to this entrance.\n\nThis is a small entrance like the Tulla Mori Gate. It is 2.13 meter wide.\n\nThis is a small entrance seems to be developed by breaking main wall (outer boundary) at latter stage by the locals as a short passage to an adjacent jungle. There is a bastion next to this gate. There is also located a dipilated pond in front of this gate within the fort, since the construction of the fort, for this reason it is now called \"Sar Gate\" as \"Sar\" means water pond.\n\nThis small mosque known as Shahi masjid is near the Kabuli gate. It has a prayer chamber and a small courtyard. It is the most decorated of the original buildings of the fort. To be ever ready in case of attack, stairs lead directly from the courtyard of this mosque to the top of Kabuli Gate.\n\nThe prayer chamber is 19.2 meter long and 7.3 meter deep. It is divided into 3 equal chambers. There are domes from the inside but from the outside no domes can be seen. There is a small room at the end of these three chambers. This room was for the Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader). This room has a small domed roof from the inside but no outer dome. There is no place for ablution (cleaning up before prayers) in the mosque. This mosque is built into the fortification wall i.e. soldiers walked over the mosque's roof. The outer wall of the mosque is the fortification wall itself.\n\nOn the outer wall of the mosque are beautiful round designs in which Islamic verses are written in Naqsh script. These verses are surrounded by a Lilly going around the Naqsh script. The Lilly design was later used by Mughals in Tomb of Jahangir, Tomb of Nur Jehan and the Shah Burj Gate in Lahore Fort. The design seems to have been copied from the coins used in that time.\n\nThere are 3 Baolis in the fort. These were made by cutting deep into the lime rock.This is used to take their horses to drink water. There are 135 steps.\n\nIt is in the middle of the Fort for soldiers, elephants, horses etc. This Baoli has 148 steps. Each step is 20 cm wide. The upper portion has been cut in stone. It has three arches that span the length of the baoli.\n\nIt is near the Kabuli Gate for the Royal family. It has 60 steps and has small chambers that were used as baths by the Royal family.\n\nA small Baoli near the Sar Gate, most likely used by soldiers.\n\nThe Rani Mahal (Queens palace) is near Haveli Man Singh. It is a one-storey structure. It originally had four rooms but only room remains standing today. The foundation of the four rooms can still be seen today.\n\nThe room still standing today is about 20 ft high and beautifully decorated on the inside and outside. The roof of the dome like room is like a flower. The inside of the roof is decorated with flowers, geometrical patterns and fake windows. The room is about 8 by.\n\nThis fort is an example of purely \"Masculine\" architecture. It places function over form. This can be gauged from the fact that the fort originally had no permanent building for living.\n\nThese carvings are found on the gate and in the mosque. Most of these are engravings in Arabic and sunflowers.\n\nOne of these carvings is inside the Shahi Mosque outside the Pesh Imam's (Prayer leaders) room. The carving is of the word \"Allah\" in Arabic. The same carving is also done on merlons on top of Shahi Mosque.\n\nThe sunflower motif is on each sides of the arches of Shahi Mosque. It is also present in the guard post in between each gate.\n\nMost of these inscriptions are on the Shahi Mosque. On the outer wall of the mosque the \"Kalima\" is written in beautiful calligraphy on both sides of each arch of the Shahi Mosque. The Naskh script is used.\n\nThere is an inscription in Persian on the Shishi gate which gives the date of start of construction. The same inscription is also found over the Talaqi gate.\n\nThere are other inscriptions on the Khwas Khani, Langar Khani and Gatali gate.\n\nThese tiles are found on Shishi gate. This type of tile became extremely popular with the Mughals who further refined them. The tiles on Shishi gate are the earliest example of the usage of these tiles. These tiles were made in Lahore.\n\nPlaster has been used in the Shahi Mosque.\n\nMachicolations are small drains that lead from the inside to the walls outside. They are built into the walls and are used by the soldiers on the inside to pour molten lead or other hot liquids on soldiers trying to scale the walls. The Rohtas Fort has hundreds of them and each one is beautifully decorated with geometric patterns. The pictures is of a machicolation near the Langar Khana (Mess Hall).\n\nThis fort was built in a style that draws from Turkish, Middle Eastern, and South Asian artistic traditions.\n\nThe fort was never popular with the Mughals because of its military character. Emperor Akbar stayed here for a single night. Emperor Jahangir rested here for a single night while going to Kashmir for a rest. He said the following about its location:\n\n\"This fort was founded in a cleft and the strength of it cannot be imagined\"\n\nEmperor Jahangir again stayed here when he was being forced to go to Kabul by Mahabat Khan. Nur Jahan, his beautiful and resourceful wife obtained troops from Lahore and ordered Mahabat Khan to release her husband. Emperor Jahangir then proceeded to Rohtas and held his court here for a while. Then he went on to Kashmir and back to Lahore to die.\n\nThe later Mughals seem to have made no use of the fort. The reason is that they were allies of the Gakhars and consequently needed no troops to maintain their hold over this area.\n\nThe Afsharid ruler Nader Shah camped at the fort during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. Thereafter it was used by the Durrani ruler Ahmad Shah Durrani during his invasions of the Punjab against the Sikhs.\n\nTimur Shah Durrani retook Multan from the Sikhs in 1780 after defeating them at Rohtas, he then secured Bhawalpur and Kashmir. By 1788 he even attempted unsuccessfully to ford the plains of Punjab to rescue his brother-in-law the weak Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II who was blinded by a eunuch Ghulam Qadir. Unable to succeed he wrote a letter to Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, requesting that the British protect the Mughal dynasty.\n\nAfter the takeover of the Punjab by Ranjit Singh, Gurmukh Singh Lamba captured the Rothas Fort from the Ghakhar chief Nur Khan, father of Fazil Dad Khan in 1825. Ranjit Singh gave the fort to Mohar Singh who was succeeded by Gurmukh Singh Lamba. It was subsequently leased to different people and the last person to manage Rohtas was Raja Fazal Din Khan who joined Sher Singh in rebellion.\n\nRohtas Fort is an outstanding example of early Muslim military architecture in the South Asia which incorporates features from elsewhere in the Islamic world. It also had a profound influence on the development of architectural styles in the Mughal Empire (and hence on the European colonial architecture that made abundant use of that tradition).\n\nIt is also outstanding by virtue of the refinement and high artistic value of its decorative elements, notably its high- and low-relief carvings, its calligraphic inscriptions in marble and sandstone, its plaster decoration, and its glazed tiles.\n\nAnd\n\nThere are no surviving examples of military architecture of this period on the same scale in the South Asia which survive to the same degree of completeness and conservation. Fatehpur Sikri (India) which is already on the World Heritage List represents the full Mughal realization of a form and style that owes everything to its precursor, Rohtas Fort.\n\nThe recommendation by ICOMOS (the organization that makes the World Heritage list) made the following recommendation\n\nRohtas Fort is an exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of central and South Asia, which blends architectural and artistic traditions from Turkey and the South Asia to create the model for Mughal architecture and its subsequent refinements and adaptations.\n\nMost of the fort is in a very good state of preservation. In the portions that have fallen away (Haveli Man Singh) one can still see some part of the original construction.\n\nThe central archway of the Chandwali Gate has been rebuilt recently so that is the only “fake” part of the fort.\n\nIn early 2005, seepage, heavy rains, and general neglect caused the left inner face of the Talaqi Gate to collapse, and the right flank and foundation to become detached from the original structure.\n\nThe Gatali Gate forms one of the original entrances to Rohtas. Over time, its right bastion and supporting wall have collapsed as a result of permeated rainwater and the erosion of its foundations.\n\nRohtas Fort was designated a World Heritage Site in 1997, having met the following inclusion criteria:\n\nCriterion (ii): \"Rohtas Fort blends architectural and artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian subcontinent to create the model for Mughal architecture and its subsequent refinements and adaptations.\" Criterion (iv): \"Rohtas Fort is an exceptional example of the Muslim military architecture of central and south Asia during the 16th century.\"\n\nThe fort was also noted for its high-level of integrity, and authenticity.\n\nThe Rohtas Fort Conservation Programme was conceived by the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation in 2000 to help protect the sixteenth-century Rohtas Fort near Jhelum, and develop it as a heritage site conforming to international standards of conservation and tourism. It is undertaking the following projects in conjunction with the Royal Norwegian Embassy.\n\nIn 1992 the government ordered the locals of Rohtas to leave the inside area of fort and state that the government would construct houses for them outside the fort. Zafar Chughtai the chairman of Rohtas opposed the stay order from government declaring that no government will take the properties of Rohtas locals. The stay order is still effective but no subsequent government has pursued its execution and has allowed the fort residents to reside there.\n\n\n * 1) Complete restoration of Shah Chandwali Gate\n * 2) Conservation of Haveli Man Singh\n * 3) Conservation of Talaqi Gate and Gatali Gate\n * 4) Establishment of Sher Shah Suri Museum in upper storey of Sohail Gate\n * 5) Improvement of quality of life in Rohtas Fort village\n\nOutside the Langar Khani Gate is the tomb of a lady called Khair Un Nisa. She was the daughter of the food minister named Qadir Bukhsh. She died here and was buried in this tomb but she was later moved to Sasaram.\n\nUntil the construction of the new Grand Trunk Road, Rohtas was a halting place on the main Peshawar-Lahore road. This road had serais about a mile apart. One of these is about one mile (1.6 km) north of the Rohtas Fort. It is in a fair state of preservation.\n\n\n\nThe dual-carriage Grand Trunk Road takes you past Gujar Khan and Sohawa, to the small city of Dina 110 km away. Just past Dina you will drive over a railway overpass, stay to the right of the road and take the first U-turn to drive back towards Dina. After about 100 meters to your left you will find a signpost, which indicates the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8 km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe. Drive on the road to enter into the fort and keep driving till you reach the parking area.\n\nDrive on G.T. road past Gujranwala, Wazirabad and the city of Jhelum. About 10 minutes drive beyond the Jhelum bridge just short of the city of Dina, you will find a signpost to the left directing you to Rohtas Fort.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n * Pothohar Plateau\n * Rawat Fort\n * Pharwala\n * Sar Jalal\n * Mankiala Stupa\n * Katasraj Temple\n\n\n * Ihsan H Nadiem, Rohtas: Formidable Fort of Sher Shah.

      "title": "Noor Mahal",
      "description": "The Noor Mahal (نور محل) is a palace in Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan. It was built in 1872 like an Italian chateau on neoclassical lines, at a time when modernism had set in. It belonged to the Nawabs of Bahawalpur princely state, during British Raj.\n\nThere are various stories regarding its construction. According to one legend, Nawab Adnan Abbasi IV had the palace made for his wife; however, she was only there for one night, as she happened to see the adjoining graveyard from her balcony, and refused to spend another night there, and so it remained unused during his reign.\n\nNoor Mehal is one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur, due to the lack of publicity. The palace is open to public. It is currently in the possession of the Pakistan Army and is used as a state guest house for holding state durbars and meetings with foreign delegations.\n\nThe construction of Noor palace was undertaken by Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan the fourth, who was also known as the Shan Jahan of Bahawalpur for his passion of constructing beautiful buildings.\n\nMr. Heennan, an Englishman who was the state engineer, designed the building. The foundation of Noor Palace was laid in 1872. A map and coins of the state were buried in its foundation as a good omen. Most of the palace's materials and furniture were imported from England and Italy. The construction of the palace was completed in 1875 at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million. Considering the amount of silver in the Indian Rupee Coin at 11.66 Grams in 1862, this amount in 2016 would come to about 8.1 million US dollars. Noor Palace covers an area of 44600 sqft. It has 32 rooms including 14 in the basement, 6 verandas and 5 domes.\n\nThe design encompasses features of Corinthian and Islamic styles of architecture with a tinge of subcontinental style. The Corinthian touch is visible in the columns, balustrade, pediments and the vaulted ceiling of Durbar Hall. The Islamic style is evident in the five domes, whereas the angular elliptical shapes are a stroke of subcontinent style. Nawab Muhammad Bahawal Khan the fifth added a mosque to the palace in 1906 at the cost of Rs. 20,000. The design is based on the mosque of Aitchison College.\n\nIn 1956, when Bahawalpur State was merged into Pakistan, the building was taken over by the Auqaf department. The palace was leased to the army in 1971; in 1997 the army purchased it for the sum of 119 million.\n\nThe building was declared a “protected monument” in September 2001 by the Government of Pakistan's Department of Archeology, and it is now open for general visitors, students trips and other interested persons.\n\nThere are a lot of old things present in it. It includes many Nawabs' used things. There are many old swords, old currency notes and coins, old laws that were made in that time, an old piano that Nawabs used to play, old furniture used by Nawabs etc. There is also a long wall in it that contains imaginary pictures of Nawabs. Only one picture is real, all others are imaginary. There is also a prison cell aside the Mahal.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n * Bahawalpur\n * Bahawalpur State\n\n* Noor Mahal Bahawalpur - information and pictures",

      "title": "Hiran Minar",
      "description": "Hiran Minar (undefined; or \"The Deer Tower\") is an early 17th-century Mughal era complex located in Sheikhupura, in the Pakistani province of Punjab.\n\nThe complex was built at the site of a game reserve in honour of Mughal Emperor Jahangir's pet antelope. The Emperor is remembered for his fondness of nature, and his complex embodies the Mughal relationship between humans, pets, and hunting.\n\nThe Hiran Minar complex is located in the city of Sheikhupura, about 40 kilometres northwest of Lahore. The complex is located near the Sheikhupura Fort, which also dates from the early 17th century. Both sites are accessible from Lahore via the M2 Motorway, which connects Lahore to the Islamabad.\n\nHiran Minar was built during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir in a hunting reserve used by the Mughal royals. The reserve was built in a scrub forest, and allowed Mughal emperors to experience a sense of semi-wilderness near the imperial city of Lahore. The game-reserve was used as a park where visitors could enjoy the sport of hunting.\n\nThe minaret itself was built in 1606 C.E. as a monument to Emperor Jahangir's beloved pet antelope, Mansiraj, or \"Light of the Mind\", who had been trained to lure wild animals to the tank in order to be hunted. The practice of building such tomb-markers over the skulls of game animals is an ancient Persian custom.\n\nThe minaret and tank were soon accompanied by a larger pavilion, built during the reign of Shah Jahan.\n\nThe complex consists of a Jahangir-era minaret situated next to a larger Shah Jahan-era complex.\n\nThe Jahangir-era minaret stands 30 metres tall, and was built in 1606 C.E. as a tomb marker for the emperor's pet antelope, Minraj. The sides of the minar are inscribed with a eulogy to the pet antelope.\n\nA massive rectangular water-tank pool measuring 229 metres by 273 metres lies at the heart of the complex. At the center of each side of the tank, a brick ramp slopes down to the water, providing access for wild game that were sought by hunters.\n\nAn octagonal pavilion built during the reign of Shah Jahan is at the centre of the pool. The pavilion is two-storeyed, and is topped by a rooftop chhatri that served as a stone gazebo. The pavilion's architecture is similar to the Sher Mandal at Delhi's Purana Qila, built by Emperor Humayun.\n\nThe pavilion was surrounded not only by the water tank, but also semi-wilderness. The pavilion was thus likely used for recreational purposes.\n\nA causeway spans the pool to connect the minaret with the pavilion along an axis which passes through a gateway.\n\nUnique features of this particular complex are the antelope's grave and the distinctive water collection system. At each corner of the tank (approximately 750 by 895 ft in size), is a small, square building and a subsurface water collection system which supplied the water tank; only one of these water systems is only extensively exposed today.\n\n\n\n\n * Photographs of Hiran Minar\n * World Heritage: Hiran Minar and Tank, Sheikhupura",

      "title": "Katas Raj Temples",
      "description": "The Katas Raj Temples (Punjabi, undefined), also known as Qila Katas, is a complex of several Hindu temples connected to one another by walkways. The temple complex surrounds a pond named Katas which is regarded as sacred by Hindus. The complex is located in the Potohar Plateau region of Pakistan's Punjab province. The temples are located near the town of Kallar Kahar, and are near the M2 Motorway.\n\nThe temples' pond is said in the Puranas to have been created from the teardrops of Shiva, after he wandered the Earth inconsolable after the death of his wife Sati. The pond occupies an area of two kanals and 15 marlas, with a maximum depth of 20 feet.\n\nThe temples play a role in the Hindu epic poem, the Mahābhārata, where the temples are traditionally believed to have been the site where the Pandava brothers spent a significant portion of their exile. It is also traditionally believed by Hindus to be the site where the brothers engaged in a riddle contest with the Yakshas, as described in the Yaksha Prashna.  Another tradition states that the Hindu deity Krishna laid the foundation of the temple, and established a hand-made shivling in it.\n\nThe temples were visited by India's former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani in 2005. In 2006, the Pakistani government began restoration works at the temples, with further improvements announced in 2017. In 2018, Pakistan issued visas to 139 Indian Hindu pilgrims to visit Katas Raj dham.\n\nThe Katas Raj Temple complex is located near Kallar Kahar, and is located at an altitude of 2,000 feet. It is approximately 100 kilometres away by road from another important Hindu pilgrimage destination - the Tilla Jogian complex. Katas Raj is located near the interchange for the town of Kallar Kahar off the M2 Motorway which links Islamabad to Lahore. The complex is located alongside the road that connects Kallar Kahar to Choa Saidan Shah near the village of Dulmial.\n\nThe name of the temple complex is believed to derive from the Sanskrit word kataksha, meaning \"tearful eyes.\" The pond was originally referred to as Viskund, or \"poison spring\", but was later referred to as Amarkund, Chamaskund, and finally Katakshkund, meaning \"Spring of tearful eyes.\" The pond in Urdu and Persian is referred to as Chashm-e-Alam, meaning \"Sorrowful/Tearful Eyes.\"\n\n\n\nThe Salt Ranges have archaeological remains still hidden underground. A number of bones of the limbs and vertebrae of animals have been found at some nearby sites. Prehistoric axes and knives made of granite, and artifacts like terracotta bangles and pottery have also been unearthed at the Katasraj site. The latter have been found to be similar to those excavated in Harappa, but have not been dated.\n\nHindu tradition holds that the temples date from the era of the Mahabharata, and is believed to be where the Pandava brothers spent a large portion of their exile. It is also believed by Hindus to be the site where the Pandavas engaged in a riddle contest with the Yakshas, as described in the Yaksha Prashna.\n\nThe 4th century CE Chinese monk, Faxian, described a temple at Katas Raj in his travelogues. The 7th century CE Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited the area and reported the existence of a Buddhist stupa dating to the era of the 3rd century BCE king, Ashoka. The stupa was reported to be 200 feet tall, and surrounded by 10 springs.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Buddhist empire of Gandhara, Hinduism gained traction in the region under the reign of the Hindu Shahis beginning around the 7th century CE. The Hindu Shahis established Hindu temples at Katas Raj from the mid 7th to 10th centuries, though the British engineer Alexander Cunningham dated the shrines to around 66 BCE. The Hindu Shahi empire also funded construction of several other temples throughout northern Punjab and the Potohar plateau, including the nearby Tilla Jogian, and Kafir Kot in Khyber Pakhtunkwa province.\n\nThe founder of the Sikh faith, Guru Nanak, is believed to have visited the Katas Raj Temples, as the site became a popular destination for ascetics. The Sikh emperor Ranjit Singh also regularly performed pilgrimage to the site. He visited the site for the Vaisakhi festival in 1806, in December 1818, and again in 1824.\n\nThe complex was a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus prior to the 1947 Partition of British India, with large numbers visiting for Shivratri. Following Partition, the local Hindu community left the region for the newly established Republic of India. The relationship of Hindus with local Muslim population was good, and local Muslims accompanied Hindus to the nearby town of Choa Saiden Shah, from where the local Hindu population departed for India. Indian pilgrims continued to visit the temple for the Shivratri festival until the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, after which Indian pilgrims were barred from visiting again until 1984.\n\nThe temples fell into disrepair over the decades following Partition, and suffered neglect. Pakistani Hindus would continue to occasionally visit the site, but were unable to maintain the expansive complex. The pond was polluted with litter, while local villagers would also use the pool for recreation. Indian Hindu pilgrims were forbidden to visit the site in 1956, 1960, and after the Indo-Pakistan war in 1965. India pilgrims were not permitted to visit the site again until 1984.\n\nIndia's former Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani visited the temples in 2005, and expressed displeasure at the site's dilapidated state. In 2005 Pakistan proposed to restore the temple complex, while in 2006 the restoration project began in order to clean the sacred pond, paint and restore some temples, and installation of informational blue boards around the temple complex. 300 Indian Hindus visited the site for the Shivratri festival in 2006, which for a short time became an annual tradition for some Indian pilgrims, though Indians stopped coming after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. 2,000 Pakistani Hindus resumed the tradition of celebrating Shivratri at the temple in 2010, and another 2,000 in 2011 with visitors coming from as far as Karachi. A wedding for Hindu couples was arranged during that year's Shivratri festival for couples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province whose families had lost much of their property in the 2010 Pakistan floods.\n\nIn January 2017, Pakistan's government began installation of shikharas on the temples. In February 2017, 200 pilgrims from India traveled to the temple to participate in the Katas Raj Dham festival.\n\nThe temples are considered to be the second most sacred site in the historic Punjab region, after the temple at Jwalamukhi in modern Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe temples derive their holiness from the legend that following the death of his wife Sati, the Hindu god Shiva wandered inconsolably, while some of his tears collected in two ponds, one of which is the pond around which the Katas Raj Temples are set, while the other is at Pushkar, near the famous Sufi pilgrimage center of Ajmer. Another version of the legend mentions the two pools at Katasraj and Nainital. Another version of the Shiva legend involves the death of Shiva's horse Katas instead of that of Sati his consort.\n\nThe Katasraj temple complex is traditionally believed to date back to the Mahabharata era. Many legends are associated with the temples. The five Pandava brothers, mentioned in the Mahabharata, are said to have stayed here for a large part of their exile. The complex is traditionally believed to be the site where the Pandava brothers were challenged by the Yaksha before being able to drink from the pond. Four of the brothers failed, and were rendered lifeless by the Yaksha. The fifth brother, Yudhishthira, engaged the Yaksha in a riddle contest, and defeated him with his wisdom, thereby bringing his brothers back to life.\n\nSome legends also state that very first Shiva Ling (Sihv-Ling) was in Kattas. some old manuscripts also consider Katas as the janam bhoomi (birthplace) of Hindu incarnation Rama, as well as that of Ayodhya; but this has become quite controversial.The oral tradition by local Hindus never mentioned it as being Rama's birthplace or celebrated in annual rituals.\n\nThe pond in the complex is believed by Hindus to be filled with Shiva's tears after the death of his wife Sati. The water in the pond is of high clarity. The water and are believed to wash one of ones own sins, as the pond is associated with Shiva. In 2012, and again in 2017, water levels in the pond were noted to decrease because of water usage at a nearby cement factory, as well as the plantation of water-avid eucalyptus trees, that had lowered the area's water table. After the 2012 episode, the local cement factory was shut down by government authorities in order to restore water levels.\n\nThe Katas site houses the Satgraha, a group of seven ancient temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, five other medieval temples, havelis scattered around a pond considered holy by Hindus.\n\nThe temples at Katas are mostly constructed on square platforms. The elevation of the sub shrines seems to form a series of cornices with small rows of pillars, crowned by a ribbed dome. The seven temples were built in an architectural style similar to Kashmiri temples, with dentils, fluted pillars, trefoil arches, and rooflines that are pointed.\n\nThe Ramachandra Mandir is situated to the east of the Hari Singh Haveli and is closed from all sides except for an entrance on the east. The double-storied structure has eight rooms of various dimensions on the ground floor and a staircase at the south leading to the first floor. The mandir has two jharokas (balconies) that have been severely damaged.\n\nThe Hanuman Mandir is on the western extreme of a high rectangular enclosure with entrances on the south and the north. The temple's ceiling is undecorated, and lime-plastered.\n\nThe Shiva temple is also built on a square platform. Its entrance is a recessed round arch with faint cusps and a rectangular opening to the north.\n\nA small fort cum residence was built during the reign of Hari Singh Nalwa, and was built for his use as a fort and residence. The fort itself is located on a small hillock and overlooks the entire temple complex.\n\nThe fort is rectangular and features four bastions, one in each corner of the fort. The walls are approximately 5 metres tall, and features an entryway in the western wall of the fort. The central portion of the fort features a small courtyard, around which an arched veranda is found. The interior rooms were not decorated.\n\nFor decades the temple complex was in bad state. The holy pond was littered with garbage, while the murals inside the temples disappeared due to the ravages of time and the neglect of the authorities. The temples were visited by India's former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani in 2005, and in 2006 Pakistan proposed to restore the temple complex.\n\nMurtis (idols) of Hindu gods were placed in the seven temples, at a cost of Rs. 51.06 million. A three-member archaeological team visited India, Sri Lanka and Nepal to collect murtis of various Hindu gods.\n\nAs of 2012, the temple pond was drying up as ground water had been diverted for industrial purposes, though the local cement factory was temporarily shut down to restore water levels. In January 2017, Pakistani authorities began the installation of shikharas on the temples, and installed a water filtration system to provide potable water for pilgrims. By May 2017, water levels in the sacred pond were again noted to be falling.\n\nIn 2016, the temple hit the national limelight after its centuries-old water pond ran dry, attributed to the depletion of groundwater owing to the establishment of four major cement factories in the area. After the menace was reported, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took a suo motu notice and started hearing the case in November. During the course of proceedings, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar remarked that cement factories were consuming water worth millions of rupees without paying their dues. He stated that taxes should be imposed on the factories and if the government would not do so, the court would take the matter into its hands.\n\nIn 2017, while hearing the case, Nisar stressed, \"This temple is not just a place of cultural significance for the Hindu community, but also a part of our national heritage. We have to protect it.\" The bench of judges during the hearing of the case also expressed displeasure at the absence or displacing of idols from the temples, demanding to know why there were no statues in the temples of Shiri Ram and Hanuman. The bench was told that a former chairman of Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) earned millions of rupees from corruption [during his tenure] and then ran away [from Pakistan].\n\nIn May 2018, the top court announced its verdict on the case by ruling that the cement factories would have to source water from elsewhere immediately, and in the meantime, pay the Government of Punjab, Pakistan for the water they draw. It told Bestway and DG Khan cement factories to fulfill their water needs from any other alluvial source such as river Jhelum.\n\nHowever, the factories disobeyed court orders and the authorities in August 2018, cut the water supply. However, the fate of the temply pond is not known as of September 2018, as industrial sourcing of groundwater in the area continues by two other cement factories - Gharibwal Cement and Dandot Cement, located in the area, but outside the red zone.\n\n\n\n\n * Hinduism in Pakistan\n * Sakesar temple, 15 km away\n * Rohtas Fort\n * Tilla Jogian\n * Nagarparkar Temples\n\n\n * Pakistan renovates Katasraj Temples\n * Picture tour of Katasraj Temples\n * The Temples of Katas Raj in Pictures",

      "title": "Khewra Salt Mine",
      "description": "The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) is located in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an administrative subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan. The mine is located in the Salt Range, an outer range of the Himalaya Mountains which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest, the world's 2nd largest.\n\nThe mine is famous for its production of pink Himalayan salt, and is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of salt in the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of salt in the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.\n\nThe Khewra Salt Mine is excavated within the base of a thick layer of highly folded, faulted, and stretched layer of Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation. This geological formation consists of a basal layer of crystalline halite, which is intercalated with potash salts. This basal layer is overlain by gypsiferous marl, which is covered by interlayered beds of gypsum and dolomite with infrequent seams of oil shale. These strata are overlain by 200 to 500 m of Neoproterozoic to Eocene sedimentary rocks that have been uplifted and eroded along with the Salt Range Formation to create the Salt Range at the southern edge of the Pothohar Plateau. The Ediacaran to early Cambrian evaporites of the Salt Range Formation have been thrust southward over Neoproterozoic to Eocene sedimentary rocks by many kilometers, which would have tectonically incorporated of fragments of the underlying younger strata within these evaporites. The Salt Range is the southern edge of a well-described fold-and-thrust belt, which underlies the entire Pothohar Plateau and developed south of the Himalayas as a result of ongoing collision between India and Eurasia.\n\nPalynomorphs, organic microfossils, have been used to make inferences about the ages of the Salt Range Formation and its salt layers that are exposed within the Khewra Salt Mine. For example, while working with Geological Survey of India in the 1930s and 1940s, Birbal Sahni reported finding evidence of angiosperms, gymnosperms and insects inside the mine which he regarded as originating from the Eocene period. However, on the basis of additional geologic data, later research has concluded that these palynomorphs were contaminants\n\nThe Khewra Salt Mine is also known as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The salt reserves at Khewra were discovered when Alexander the Great crossed the Jhelum and Mianwali region during his Indian campaign. The mine was discovered, however, not by Alexander, nor by his allies, but by his army's horses, when they were found licking the stones. Ailing horses of his army also recovered after licking the rock salt stones. During the Mughal era the salt was traded in various markets, as far away as Central Asia. On the downfall of the Mughal empire, the mine was taken over by Sikhs. Hari Singh Nalwa, the Sikh Commander-in-Chief, shared the management of the Salt Range with Gulab Singh, the Raja of Jammu. The former controlled the Warcha mine, while the latter held Khewra. The salt quarried during Sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source of revenue.\n\nIn 1872, some time after they had taken over the Sikhs' territory, the British developed the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the mine was poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the mine was over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.\n\n\n\nKhewra Salt Mine is situated in Pind Dadan Khan Tehsil of Jhelum District. Located about 160 km (100 miles) from Islamabad and Lahore, it is accessed via the M2 motorway, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) off the Lilla interchange while going towards Pind Dadan Khan on the Lilla road. The mine is in mountains that are part of a salt range, a mineral-rich mountain system extending about 200 km from the Jhelum river south of Pothohar Plateau to where the Jhelum river joins the Indus river. Khewra mine is about 288 meters (945 feet) above sea level and about 730 meters (2400 feet) into the mountain from the mine entrance. The underground mine covers an area of 110 km 2 (43 sq. miles).\n\n\n\nEstimates of the total reserves of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In the early years of British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.\n\nThe mine comprises nineteen stories, of which eleven are below ground. From the entrance, the mine extends about 730 meters (2440 ft) into the mountains, and the total length of its tunnels is about 40 km (25 miles). Quarrying is done using the room and pillar method, mining only half of the salt and leaving the remaining half to support what is above. The temperature inside the mine remains about 18 – throughout the year. The narrow gauge Khewra Salt Mines Railway track laid during the British era is used to bring salt out of the mine in rail cars.\n\nHimalayan salt is Pakistan's best known rock salt. It is used for cooking, as bath salt, as brine and as a raw material for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. Salt from Khewra mine is also used to make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock salt, as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.\n\nIn 2008 the Government of Pakistan decided to sell off seventeen profitable organisations including Khewra salt mines, but the plan was shelved. The mine is now operated by the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, a government department.\n\n\n\nKhewra Salt Mine is a major tourist attraction, with around 250,000 visitors a year, earning it considerable revenue. Visitors are taken into the mine on the Khewra Salt Mines Railway. There are numerous pools of salty water inside. The Badshahi Masjid was built in the mining tunnels with multi-coloured salt bricks about fifty years ago. Other artistic carvings in the mine include a replica of Minar-e-Pakistan, a statue of Allama Iqbal, an accumulation of crystals that form the name of Muhammad in Urdu script, a model of the Great Wall of China and another of the Mall Road of Murree. In 2003 two phases of development of tourist facilities and attractions were carried out, at a total cost of 9 million rupees. A clinical ward with 20 beds was established in 2007, costing 10 million rupees, for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases using salt therapy. The \"Visit Pakistan Year 2007\" event included a train safari visit of Khewra Salt Mine. In February 2011 Pakistan railways started operating special trains for tourists from Lahore and Rawalpindi to Khewra. For this purpose the railway station of Khewra was refurbished with the help of a private firm.\n\nOther visitor attractions in the mine include the 75-meter-high (245 feet) Assembly Hall; Pul-Saraat, a salt bridge with no pillars over a 25-meters-deep (80-foot-deep) brine pond; Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), where salt crystals are light pink; and a café.\n\nThe Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation established the Mine Survey Institute at Khewra in 1971. The institute conducts mine surveys, organises mining-related courses for the miners and has establishes the Khewra Model High School and the Khewra Women College. More recently the miners won an important environmental case against the mining company for the provision of unpolluted drinking water. The water available to the residents of Khewra had been polluted by salt, coal and other nearby mining activity. This case is internationally recognised as important with regard to the relationship between humanity and the environment.\n\nIn 2003, while the Government of Pakistan was looking for ways to increase the country's strategic store of oil to 90 days, the PMDC put forward a proposal to use the Khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves. Scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal, but it was turned down.\n\nIn 2010, during torrential rain all over Pakistan, water from a nearby nullah entered the mine, reaching a depth of two feet (60 cm) and blocking the exits, after which the mine was closed. It was subsequently reopened and remains open.\n\n\n\n* Khewra Salt Mines – Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation",

      "title": "Uch",
      "description": "Uch (اوچ; \"Uuch\"), frequently referred to as Uuch Sharīf (undefined; \"Noble Uch\"), is an historic city in the southern part of Pakistan's Punjab province. Uch may have been founded as Alexandria on the Indus, a town founded by Alexander the Great during his invasion of the Indus Valley. Uch was an early stronghold of the Delhi Sultanate during the Muslim conquest of the subcontinent. Uch was a regional metropolitan centre between the 12th and 17th centuries, and became refuge for Muslim religious scholars fleeing persecution from other lands. Though Uch is now a relatively small city, it is renowned for intact historic urban fabric, and for its collection of shrines dedicated to Muslim mystics from the 12-15th centuries that are embellished with extensive tile work, and were built in the distinct architectural style of southern Punjab.\n\nUch was previous known by the name of Deogarh (\"Stronghold of Giants\") until the 12th century. The origins of the city's current name are unclear. In one legend, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, the renowned Central Asian Sufi mystic from Bukhara, arrived in Uch and converted the daughter of the town's ruler, Sunandapuri. Upon her conversion, Jalaluddin Bukhari requested her to built a fortress which he named Uch, or \"High.\" According to another version of the legend, the princess converted by Bukhari was actually a Buddhist princess named Ucha Rani, and the city's name name derives from her. In another version of then legend, Ucha Rani and her sister Sita Rani, rulers of Uch and Sitapur, both married Bukhari.\n\nHowever, the local rulers of Uch had long been Muslim by the time of Bukhari's arrival in the mid 1200s, and so the legends' non-Muslim princess is likely a work of fiction.\n\nThe name Uch for the area was not universally recognized for quite some time, and the city was not referred to by early Muslim historians by the name Uch. Uch, for example, is likely the town recorded as Bhatia that was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1006.\n\n\n\nUch may have been founded in 325 BCE by Alexander the Great as the city of Alexandria on the Indus (Greek: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ ἐν Ἰνδῷ), according to British officer and archaeologist Alexander Cunningham. The city was reportedly settled by natives of the Greek region of Thrace, and was located at the confluence of the Acesines river with the Indus. Uch was once located on the banks of the Indus River, though the river has since shifted its course, and the confluence of the two rivers has shifted approximately 25 miles southwest. The old city of Uch was likely abandoned around 77 CE.\n\nIn 712 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Uch. Few details exist of the city in the centuries prior to his invasion. Uch was probably the town recorded as Bhatia that was conquered in 1006 by Mahmud of Ghazni. Following the schism between the Nizari and Musta'li sects of Ismaili Shi'ism in 1094, Uch became a centre of Nizari missionary activity for several centuries, and today the town and surrounding region are littered with numerous tombs of prominent pīrs, as well as pious daughters and wives of those Sufi pirs.\n\nThe region around Uch and Multan remained centre of Hindu Vaishnavite and Surya pilgrimage throughout the medieval era. Their interactions with Ismaili tradition resulted in the creation of the Satpanth tradition. Throughout this era, Uch was at the centre of a region that was steeped in both Vedic and Islamic traditions. The city would later become a centre of Suhrwadi Sufism, with the establishment of the order by Bahauddin Zakariya in nearby Multan in the early 1200s.\n\nMuhammad of Ghor conquered Uch and nearby Sultan in 1175 while it was still under the influence of the Ismaili Qarmatians. The town was likely captured from the Soomra dynasty based in Sindh - Sindh's various dynasties had for centuries attempted to keep Uch and Multan under their sway.\n\nSoomra power was eroded by the advance of Nasir ad-Din Qabacha of what would later become the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Qabacha was declared Governor of Uch in 1204. Under his rule, Uch became the principal city of Upper Sindh. Qabacha declared independence for his principality centred on Uch and Multan after the death of Sultan Aybak in 1211, before marching onwards to capture Lahore, thereby placing Qabacha's new Uch Sultanate in conflict with Sultan Iltutmish in Delhi. Qabacha briefly lost control of Uch to Taj al-Din Yildiz, though Uch was quickly returned to Qabacha's rule.\n\nWhile the power struggle ensued among Qabacha and Iltuthmish, Uch came under further pressure from the Khwarazmian dynasty based in Samarkand that had been displaced by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan. Following the defeat of his father by the Mongols in the mid 1210s, the last Khwarazmian Sultan, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, sacked and conquered Uch in 1224 after Qabacha refused to aid him in a campaign against Genghis Khan. Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu was finally defeated by Genghis Khan in 1224 in a battle at Uch, and was forced to flee to Persia. Khan attacked Multan on his return to Iran in 1224, though Sultan Qabacha was able to successfully defend that city. Despite repeated invasions, the city remained a great centre of Muslim scholarship, as evidenced by the appointment of the renowned Persian historian Minhaj-i-Siraj as chief of the city's Firozi madrasa.\n\nIn 1228, Qabacha's forces, weakened by Mongol and Khwarazmian invasions, lost Uch to Sultan Iltutmish of Delhi, and fled south to Bhakkar in Sindh, where he was eventually captured and drowned in the Indus River as punishment. Following the collapse of Qabacha's sultanate at the hands of Mongols and Khwarazmians, and the degradation of Lahore from years of conflict there, Muslim power in north India shifted away from Punjab and towards the safer environs Delhi.\n\nOne of Uch's most celebrated saints, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, migrated to Uch from Bukhara in 1244-45. In 1245-46, the Mongols again invaded Uch under Möngke Khan after receiving aid from the local Khokhar tribes. in 1252, forces from Delhi were sent to the region in order to secure Uch from Mongol raiders, though Uch was again raided in 1258. Uch was raided yet again by Mongols in 1304 and 1305. Following the 1305 invasion, Uch came under the governoship of Ghazi Beg, who would later seize Delhi and come to be known as Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, founder of the Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Uch was captured in 1398 by Pir Muhammad ibn Jahangir, grandson of Tamerlane, allowing Khizr Khan to regain control of the area, before joining with the forces of the elder Tamerlane to sack Delhi and establish the Sayyid dynasty in 1414.\n\nUch then came under the control of the Langah Sultanate in the early 15th century, founded in nearby Multan by Budhan Khan, who assumed the title Mahmud Shah. During the rule of Shah Husayn Langah, large numbers of Baloch settlers were invited to settle in the region. The city was placed under the jagir governorship of a Samma prince. In the mid 1400s, Muhammed Ghaus, a descendant of the Persian saint Abdul Qadir Gilani, established a Khanqah monastery in Uch, thereby establishing the city as a centre of the Qadiriyya Sufi order which would later become the dominant order of Punjab. Following the death of Shah Husayn, Uch's Samma rulers quickly allied themselves with Baloch chieftain Mir Chakar Rind.\n\nGuru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have visited Uch in the early 1500s, and left behind 5 relics, after meeting with the descendants of Jalaludin Bukhari. In 1525 Uch was invaded by rulers of the Arghun dynasty of northern Sindh, before falling to the forces of Pashtun king Sher Shah Suri in 1540.Mughal Emperor Humayun entered Uch in late 1540, but was not welcomed by the city's inhabitants, and was defeated by the forces of Sher Shah Suri. The city reverted to Arghun rule following the expulsion of Humayun, and the fall of Sher Shah Suri's short-lived empire.\n\nUch became a part of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar, and the city was a district of Multan province. Under Mughal rule, the city continued to flourish as a centre of religious scholarship. In 1680, the renowned Punjabi poet, Bulleh Shah, who is regarded as a saint by both Sufis and Sikhs, was born in Uch. In 1751, Uch was attacked by Sardar Jahan Khan, general in the army of Ahmad Shah Durrani.\n\nUch came under the control of the Bahawalpur princely state, which declared independence in 1748 following the collapse of the Durrani empire. Bahawalpur had become a vassal of the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, before becoming a dependency of the British Empire defined under an 1833 treaty. By 1836, the ruling Abbasi family stopped paying tribute to the Sikhs, and declared independence. Bahawalpur's ruling Abbasi family aligned themselves with the British during the Anglo-Sikh wars, thereby guaranteeing its survival as a princely state.\n\nFlooding in the early 19th century caused serious damage to many of the city's tombs, including structural problems and the deterioration of masonry and finishes.\n\nUpon the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Uch had a population of around 2-3,000 people. As part of Bahawalpur state, Uch was acceded to the new Pakistani state, but remained part of the autonomous Bahawalpur state until 1955 when it was fully amalgamated into Pakistan. Uch remains a relatively small city, but is an important tourist and pilgrimage destination on account of its numerous tombs and shrines.\n\nUch is located 84 km away from Bahawalpur. Formerly located at the confluence of the Indus and Chenab rivers, the river shifted course, and is now 25 mi from that confluence, which has moved to Mithankot. The city now lies on a large Alluvial plain near south of the Chenab river. To the southeast lay the vast expanses of the Cholistan Desert.\n\nUch has retained much of its historic urban fabric intact. The historic town is divided into three localities: Uch Bukhari, named for the saints from Bukhara, Uch Gilani (or Uch Jilani), named for the saints from Persia, and Uch Mughlia, named for the descendants of Mongol invaders who had settled in that quarter. Monuments are scattered throughout the city, and are connected by narrow lanes and winding bazaars. The most notable collection, called the Uch Monument Complex, is located at the old city's western edge. The old core is next to a large field used as a mela ground, or fair ground for urs festivals dedicated to the town's saints.\n\nUch features an arid climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) with very hot summers and mild winters.\n\n17 tiled funerary monuments and associated structures remain tightly knit into the urban fabric of Uch. The shrines, notably the tombs of Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari and his family, are built in a regional vernacular style particular to southern Punjab, with tile work imported from the nearby city of Multan. These structures were typically domed tombs on octagonal bases, with elements of Tughlaq military architecture, such as the addition of decorative bastions and crenellations.\n\nThree shrines built over the course of 200 years are particularly well known, and along with an accompanying 1400 graves form the Uch Monument Complex, a site tentatively inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites. Of the shrines, the first is said to have been built for Sheikh Baha’al-Halim by his pupil, the Suharwardiya Sufi saint Jahaniyan Jahangasht (1307–1383), the second for the latter’s great-granddaughter, Bibi Jawindi, in 1494, and the third for the latter’s architect.\n\nFlooding in the early 19th century caused serious damage to many of the city's tombs, including structural problems and the deterioration of masonry and finishes. As the problems have persisted, the Uch Monument Complex was listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund, and again in 2000 and 2002. The Fund subsequently offered financial assistance for conservation from American Express.\n\n2018 (Current)\n\nSyed Sami ul Hassan Gilani Member National Assembly PTI\n\nMakhdoom Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani Member Provincial Assembly PTI\n\n2013\n\nSyed Ali Hassan Gillani Member National Assembly PML(N)\n\nMakhdoom Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani Member Provincial Assembly(BNAP)\n\n2008\n\nArif Aziz Sheikh Member National Assembly PPPP\n\nMakhdoom Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani Member Provincial Assembly PML(Q)\n\n\n * Tomb of Bibi Jawindi\n * List of mausolea\n\n*Henry George Raverty, Notes on Afghanistan and Baluchistan; (1878)\n\n\n * Uch Sharif\n * Uch Sharif : New Photographs on Uch Sharif\n * Uch : A detailed photographic description of all famous places of Uch Sharif\n * Shrine of Bibi Jawindi, Uch Sharif\n * UNESCO World Heritage Foundation - Tomb of Bibi Jawindi, Baha'al-Halim and Ustead and the Tomb and Mosque of Jalaluddin Bukhari\n * Photographs\n * Bibi Jawindi Tomb-ArchNet\n * Livius Uch Picture Archive\n * Pictures - Tomb of Bibi Jawindi",

      "title": "Murree",
      "description": "Murree (Punjabi, undefined, marī, meaning \"apex\") is a mountain resort town, located in the Galyat region of the Pir Panjal Range, within the Rawalpindi District of Punjab, Pakistan. It forms the outskirts of the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, and is about 30 km northeast of Islamabad. It has average altitude of 2291 m.\n\nConstruction of the town was started in 1851 on the hill of Murree as a sanatorium for British troops. The permanent town of Murree was constructed in 1853 and the church was consecrated shortly thereafter. One main road was established, commonly referred to even in modern times, as the mall. Murree was the summer headquarters of the colonial Punjab Government until 1876 when it was moved to Shimla.\n\nMurree became a popular tourist station for British within the British India, several prominent Englishmen were born here including Bruce Bairnsfather, Francis Younghusband and Reginald Dyer. During colonial era access to commercial establishments was restricted for non-Europeans including the Lawrence College. In 1901, the population of the town was officially 1,844, although if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.\n\nSince the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, Murree has retained its position as a popular hill station, noted for its pleasant summers. A large number of tourists visit the town from the Islamabad-Rawalpindi area. The town also serves as a transit point for tourist's visiting Azad Kashmir and Abbottabad. The town is noted for its Tudorbethan and neo-gothic architecture. The Government of Pakistan owns a summer retreat in Murree, where foreign dignitaries including heads of state often visit.\n\nThe town is considered by some of its locals and by adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement to be the final resting place of Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\nMurree or Marhee as it was then called, was first identified as a potential hill station by Major James Abbott (Indian Army officer) in 1847.\n\nThe town's early development was in 1851 by President of the Punjab Administrative Board, Sir Henry Lawrence. It was originally established as a sanatorium for British troops garrisoned on the Afghan frontier. Officially, the municipality was created in 1850.\n\nThe permanent town of Murree was constructed at Sunnybank in 1853. The church was sanctified in May 1857, and the main road, Jinnah Road, originally known as Mall Road and still commonly referred to as \"The Mall\"), was built. The most significant commercial establishments, the Post Office, general merchants with European goods, tailors and a millinery, were established opposite the church. Until 1947, access to Mall Road was restricted for \"natives\" (non-Europeans).\n\nIn the summer of 1857, a rebellion against the British broke out. The local tribes of Murree and Hazara, including the Dhund Abbasis and others, attacked the depleted British Army garrison in Murree; however, the tribes were ultimately overcome by the British and capitulated. From 1873 to 1875, Murree was the summer headquarters of the Punjab local government; after 1876 the headquarters were moved to Shimla.\n\nThe railway connection with Lahore, the capital of the Punjab Province, via Rawalpindi, made Murree a popular resort for Punjab officials, and the villas and other houses erected for the accommodation of English families gave it a European aspect. The houses crowned the summit and sides of an irregular ridge, the neighbouring hills were covered during the summer with encampments of British troops, while the station itself was filled with European visitors from the plains and travellers to Kashmir. It was connected with Rawalpindi by a service tangas.\n\nIt was described in the Gazetteer of Rawalpindi District, 1893–94 as follows:\n\nThe sanatorium of Murree lies in north latitude 33° 54′ 30″ and east longitude 73° 26′ 30″, at an elevation of 7517 ft above sea level, and contained a standing population of 1,768 inhabitants, which was, however, enormously increased during the [May–November] season by the influx of visitors and their attendant servants and shopkeepers. It is the most accessible hill station in the Punjab, being distant from Rawalpindi only a five hours' journey by tonga dak. Magnificent views are to be obtained in the spring and autumn of the snow crowned mountains of Kashmir; and gorgeous sunset and cloud effects seen daily during the rains [July–August]. Part of the station, especially the Kashmir end, are also well wooded and pretty.\n\nIn 1901 the permanent population of the town was 1,844; if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.\n\nMurree features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. It is situated in the outer Himalayas, retaining high altitude. This type of area has cold, snowy winters, relatively cool summers with drastically escalated rain, in relation with lower altitudes, and frequent fog. Precipitation is received year round, with two maxima, first one during winter and second one at summer, July–August. Total mean precipitation annually is 1789 mm.Murree receives around 62.6 inches of snow per year according to a 13-year data.\n\nA variety of rare animal species can be found in Murree, including the leopard, which inhabits the neighboring Galiyat region. Common animals include the rhesus monkey, wild boar, foxes and various species of birds, including the cheer pheasant and kalij pheasant. Murree gives its name to the Murree vole, a rodent species endemic to Pakistan. Murree's climate is unpredictable. It can change any time.\n\n\n * Sadaqat Ali Abbasi,Politician & Sitting MNA\n * Shahid Khakan Abbasi, former Prime Minister of Pakistan\n * Ansar Abbasi, journalist and socially conservative commentator\n * Muztar Abbasi, scholar\n * Zafar Mahmood Abbasi, Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) of Pakistan Navy\n * Mehtab Abbasi, politician\n * khaqan Abbasi, politician\n * Marriyum Aurangzeb, politician\n * Kashif Abbasi, journalist, television talk show host and anchorperson\n * Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, politician\n * Sadia Abbasi, politician\n * Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi, former justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a former justice of Lahore High Court\n * Reginald Dyer, British Army Officer\n * Mohammad Wasim, Cricketer\n * Muhammad Riaz Khan, Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)\n\n\n\n*\n\n",

It is located approximately 9 kilometres from Murree city.\n\nBhurban is situated in between Murree and Kashmir Road at a height of about 6000 feet. It has recently been made accessible by the dual Islamabad-Murree Expressway, making it a 45-minute drive from Islamabad, the federal capital of Pakistan.\n\nBhurban is a tourist destination with unique flora, and a fauna with a variety species not found elsewhere in Pakistan. It is known for the hiking trails in the nearby Ayubia National Park. The '5 star' Pearl Continental Hotel - Mount Pleasant Apartments is one of several resorts in Bhurban that serve tourists visiting the Murree Hills and the national park. Bhurban also has a nine-hole golf course. Another resort in Bhurban is the Bhurban Hill Apartments, located 2 km from PC Bhurban. It has its own source of natural mineral water.\n\nBhurban's main tribes are Dhunds (now called Abbasis),Janyals,all being indigenous descendants of Muslim hill tribes who have lived here for centuries. Many of these tribes converted to Islam during the 14th to 15th centuries AD Most of them still live simple rural lives, whilst a number of them have gone on to seek education and jobs in the plains, in Rawalpindi and Islamabad and even further afield.\n\nThe Rawat Union Council is also responsible for managing Bhurban. Rawat village is the headquarters of the Union Council of Rawat, which is an administrative sub-division of Murree Tehsil, in the Rawalpindi District of Punjab.\n\n",

Patriata is located in Murree Tehsil which is a subdivision of Rawalpindi District. It is the highest point in the area and the hills stand 7500 ft above sea level.\n\nThe hill station is a tourist location as the climate here is much cooler than further south.

The old lady didn't know English, and was carrying flour in a pot on her head. She thought that the man was asking about what she was carrying. So she replied him in north Punjabi or Pakistani \"Puttar, Atta\" in English it means \"Son, (it's) flour\". From this the place was named as Pathriata and is similar to the Pakistani (or North Punjabi) words Puttar Atta.\n\n* Travel Tips on Patriata\n * latest pictures of Patriata\n * Travel Tips on Patriata",

      "title": "Fort Munro",
      "description": "Fort Munro (undefined), (Balochi: تمن لیغاری or فورٹ منرو) also known as Tuman Leghari, is a hill station, located at a height of 6,470 feet above sea level  in Dera Ghazi Khan. It attracts many people for short stays during the hot summer. It is around 85 kilometres from Dera Ghazi Khan city, Punjab, Pakistan and about 185 kilometres from Multan in Sulaiman Mountain range. The people of Fort Munro are nomads, especially of the Leghari tribe.\n\nFort Munro lies on the Quetta Road at 85 km from Dera Ghazi Khan. It is the only hill station in southern Punjab in the Sulaiman Mountain range. Its altitude is 1800 meters and attracts many people for short stays during the summer. Fort Munro can be reached either from Loralai Balochistan or from Multan (Punjab). From Punjab, the mountain range starts near Rakhni, which is a border-post between Balochistan and Punjab.\n\nThe town was founded by Robert Groves Sandeman in the later part of the 19th century and named Fort Munro after Colonel A. A. Munro who was commissioner of the Derajat Division.\n\nFort Munro is part of the Sulaiman Mountain range. The range is located in central Pakistan, extending southward about 280 miles (450 km) from the Gumal Pass to just north of Jacobabad, separating the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab from Balochistan. Its heights gradually decrease toward the south, with summits averaging 6,000–7,000 feet, the highest being the twin peaks (30 miles from the Gumal Pass) called Takht-i Sulaiman, or Solomon's Throne, which legend connects with King Solomon's visit to Pakistan; the higher of the peaks, at 18,481 feet (5,633 m), is the site of a Muslim Ziyarat (shrine) visited annually by many pilgrims. The range's eastern face dips steeply to the Indus River, but on the west the range declines more gradually. Juniper and edible pines abound in the north and olives in the centre, but vegetation is scarce in the south. The Ghat, Zao, Chuhar Khel Dhana, and Sakhi Sarwar are the principal passes in the north. In the south, west of Dera Ghazi Khan, lies the hill station of Fort Munro.\n\nIt attracts a number of tourists every year, particularly those who wish to escape from hot plains of southern Punjab to enjoy mild and pleasant weather for a day or two. The Punjab Government has released over Rs2 billion in July 2015 for the provision of basic facilities at the hill station in a bid to make it an important tourist haven. Out of the funds, Rs750 million would be spent on the installation of the chairlift and cable car facility between Fort Munro and Khar, Rs300 million on the provision of clean drinking water, Rs300 million on a wastewater treatment and drainage scheme, Rs1.60 billion on the construction of six new carpeted roads and a cadet college.\n\nAdditionally, state-of-the-art landscaping initiatives and the cultivation of cut flowers would also promote development in the region and open new avenues of employment. The Forest Department would afforest 300 acres in the hill station’s vicinity. The Irrigation Department is also believed to have forwarded a proposal regarding the construction of six small dams in Fort Munro’s vicinity. The development project, which is expected to kick off soon, to attract people from surrounding areas being the only hill station of southern Punjab in Dera Ghazi Khan district. Fort Munro is a cool resort in summers for the people living in south Punjab.\n\nMany ill people come here for refreshment or convalescence.\n\n\n * Munroe Island, an inland island in Kerala, India which is also named after Colonel Munro\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n\n* Fort Munro's Photos by Qadeer Ahmad Janjua",

There are mountains on its western and southern sides. On the other two sides are agricultural areas.\n\nIn 1913, British engineers, to meet the scarcity of irrigation and drinking water, built a dam on this Namal lake and irrigated lands up to Mianwali city. But with the passage of time and construction of Thal Canal and installation of tube wells, its utility of water squeezed up to some limit.\n\nThe gates of the dam are repaired by the irrigation department regularly but without enthusiasm. The hill torrents and rains fill the Namal Lake round the year. Due to a drought-like situation in the country, this lake dried up last year, which is the first incident of its kind during the last 100 years. Presently, its condition is very bad.\n\n\n * List of lakes in Pakistan\n * Namal College\n\n\n * Namal Valley\n * jeeran",

      "description": "The Soon Valley (undefined) is in the north west of Khushab District, Punjab, Pakistan. Its largest settlement is the town of Naushera. The valley extends from the village of Padhrar to Sakesar, the highest peak in the Salt Range. The valley is 35 mi long and has an average width of 9 mi. It covers a 300 sqmi area. Soon Valley has much scenic beauty, with lakes, waterfalls, jungle, natural pools and ponds. The valley has been settled since ancient times, including by the Awan tribe, whose descendants still live in the valley.\n\nThe peak of Mount Sakesar is at 5010 ft above sea level. It was once the summer headquarters of the Deputy Commissioners of three districts - Campbelpur (now Attock), Mianwali and Shahpur (now Sargodha). It is the only mountain in this part of the Punjab which receives snowfall in winter. In the late 1950s the Pakistan Air Force placed a radar station on Sarkesar to monitor airspace over north-eastern Pakistan. Also on the mountain is a television transmission center with which the Pakistan Television Corporation relays its transmissions to the surrounding area.\n\n\n * Distance from Islamabad: 170 km\n * Distance from Sargodha: 90 km\n * Distance from Lahore: 300 km\n * Distance from Karachi: 1212 km\n\nIn 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul and followed it by conquests within the Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab.\n\nThe Janjua clan settled in the valley when Babur, the first Mughal emperor passed through on military campaigns, according to his memoirs, the Baburnama. The grave of Raja Tatar Khan Janjua is in Khutakka (Ahmadabad), the centre of his rule. The remnants of his fort 'Akrand' still stand. The Janjua were scattered after the attack of Hari Singh Bhangi in 1760 and their descendants settled in Kattha, Ratala Rajgaan, Jaswal, Dhak, Jauharabad and Shahpur.\n\nThe Awans of the Soon Valley were also amongst those the British considered to be \"martial race\". The British recruited army heavily from Soon Valley for service in the colonial army, and as such, the Awans of this area also formed an important part of the British Indian Army, serving with distinction during World Wars I and II. Of all the Muslim groups recruited by the British, proportionally, the Awans produced the greatest number of recruits during the First and Second World Wars. Contemporary historians Professor Ian Talbot and Professor Tan Tai Yong have asserted that the Awans (amongst other tribes) are viewed as a martial race by not only the British, but neighbouring tribes as well. Awans occupy the highest ranks of the Pakistani Army. A village by the name of Manawan (formerly Man Awan - The heart of the Awans) is also among the notable historical villages of the valley.\n\nThe Valley has devoted its sons to Pakistan Armed forces. Notable personalities are:\n * Major General Muhammad Hussain Shaheed\n * Air Vice Martial Muhammad Sardar\n\nThe Government of Punjab constructed the road from Nurewala to Naushehra in recognition of services rendered by the Awans of Soon Valley during the First World War. Sir W.M. Hailey, the Governor of Punjab formally opened the road on April 1, 1928 - as commemorated on plaques between Khushab and Sakesar as the road enters the hills.\n\nMany inhabitants of the valley descend from tribes of Arab origin(unauthenticated information). Islamic culture and traditions are the norm. Practices include arranged marriages according to the Islamic traditions, where the wedding ceremony takes place at a mosque. The Nikah is attended by close family members, relatives, and friends of the bride and groom. Usually men and women are separated, either sitting in separate rooms or with a purdah (curtain) separating them.\n\nLuddi is a folk dance for celebratory occasions, when the music is often played on the dhol drum and shehnai oboe.\n\nLake Uchhali is a picturesque salt water lake in the southern Salt Range overlooked by mount Sakaser, the highest mountain in the Salt Range. Its brackish water means that its waters are lifeless. Lake Khabikki is also a salt water lake in the southern Salt Range. It is one kilometer wide and two kilometres long. Khabikki is also the name of a neighbouring village. These lakes attract thousands of migratory birds each year including rare white-headed ducks (Oxyura leucocephala) from Central Asia.

      "description": "The Chenab River (ਚਨਾਬ ; undefined), known traditionally as the Chandrabhaga River (चन्द्रभागा), is a major river that flows in India and Pakistan, and is one of the 5 major rivers of the Punjab region. It rises in the upper Himalayas in the Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh state, India, and flows through the Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban, Reasi and Jammu districts of Jammu region in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of Punjab, Pakistan, before flowing into the Indus River near the city of Uch Sharif. The waters of the Chenab were allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\nThe river is formed by the confluence of two rivers, Chandra and Bhaga, at Tandi, 8 km southwest of Kyelang, in the Lahaul and Spiti district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The Bhaga river originates from Surya taal lake, which is situated a few kilometers east of the Bara-lacha la pass in the in Himachal Pradesh. The Chandra river originates from glaciers east of the same pass. This pass also acts as a water-divide between these two rivers. The Chandra river transverses 115 km before the confluence. The Bhaga river transverses through narrow gorges a distance of 60 km before the confluence at Tandi.\n\nThe Chenab river was called  (असिक्नी) in the Rigveda (VIII.20.25, X.75.5). The name meant that it was seen to have dark-coloured waters. The term Krishana is also found in the Atharvaveda. A later form of Askikni was Iskamati (इस्कामति) and the Greek form was - Akesínes; Latinized to Acesines.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, the common name of the river was Chandrabhaga (चंद्रभाग) because the river is formed from the confluence of the Chandra and the Bhaga rivers. This name was also known to the Ancient Greeks, who Hellenised it in various forms such as Sandrophagos, Sandabaga and Cantabra. The similarity of Sandrophagos (Σανδροφάγος) to Androphagos (Ἀνδροφάγος), meaning cannibals, or to Alexandrophagos (Ἀλεξανδροφάγος), meaning those who would eat Alexander, likely caused the followers of Alexander to change the name to avoid the evil omen, the more so perhaps on account of the disaster which befell the Macedonian fleet at the turbulent junction of the river with the Hydaspes (modern Jhelum River).\n\nThe simplification of Chandrabhaga to 'Chenab', with evident Persianate influence, probably occurred in early medieval times and is witnessed in Alberuni.\n\nThe river was known to Indians in the Vedic period  In 325 BC, Alexander the Great allegedly founded the town of Alexandria on the Indus (present day Uch Sharif or Mithankot or Chacharan in Pakistan) at the confluence of the Indus and the combined stream of Punjab rivers (currently known as the Panjnad River).\n\nThe river has rich power generation potential in India. • Salal Dam - 690 MW hydroelectric power project near Reasi\n\n• Baglihar Dam - a hydroelectric power project near Batote in Doda district\n\n• Dul Hasti Hydroelectric Plant - 390 MW run-of-the-river type power project in Kishtwar District\n\n• Pakal Dul Dam - a proposed dam on a tributary Marusadar River in Kishtwar District\n\n• Ratle Hydroelectric Plant - an under construction power station of run-of-the-river type near Drabshalla in Kishtwar District\n\n• Kiru Hydroelectric Power Project (624 MW proposed) located in Kishtwar district\n\n• Kwar Hydroelectric Power Project (540 MW proposed) located in Kishtwar district\n\n• Marala Headworks - located near Sialkot\n\n• Khanki Headworks - located in Gujranwala District\n\n• Trimmu Barrage - located in Jhang District\n\n\n\n• Rivers of Jammu and Kashmir\n\n• Beas River\n\n• Indus River\n\n• Jhelum River\n\n• Ravi River\n\n• Satluj River\n\n\n\n*",

      "title": "Sutlej",
      "description": "The Sutlej River (alternatively spelled as Satluj River) (ਸਤਲੁਜ; शतद्रुम (shatadrum); undefined), is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan. The Sutlej River is also known as Satadree. It is addressed as Shatarudra by the Gorkhalis. It is the easternmost tributary of the Indus River.\n\nThe waters of the Sutlej are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and are mostly diverted to irrigation canals in India. There are several major hydroelectric projects on the Sutlej, including the 1,000 MW Bhakra Dam, the 1,000 MW Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant, and the 1,530 MW Nathpa Jhakri Dam. The river basin area in India is located in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and Haryana states.\n\nThe source of the Sutlej is west of Lake Rakshastal in Tibet, as springs in an ephemeral stream channel descending from this lake. Rakshastal in turn is ephemerally connected by Ganga Chhu to sacred Lake Manasarovar about 4 km further east. The nascent river flows at first west-northwest for about 260 km under the Tibetan name Langqên Zangbo (Elephant River or Elephant Spring) to the Shipki La pass, entering India in Himachal Pradesh state. It then turns slightly, heading west-southwest for about 360 km to meet the Beas River near Makhu, Firozpur district, Punjab state. Ropar Wetland in Punjab state is located on the Sutlej river basin. Evidence suggests Indus Valley Civilisation also flourished here. Ungti Chu and Pare Chu rivers which drain southeastern part of Jammu and Kashmir state are tributaries of Sutlej river.\n\nContinuing west-southwest, the Sutlej enters Pakistan about 15 km east of Bhedian Kalan, Kasur District, Punjab province, continuing southwest to water the ancient and historical former Bahawalpur princely state.\n\nAbout 17 km north of Uch Sharif, the Sutlej unites with the Chenab River, forming the Panjnad River, which finally flows into the Indus river about 100 km west of the city of Bahawalpur. The area to the southeast on the Pakistani side of the Indian border is called the Cholistan Desert and, on the Indian side, the Thar Desert.\n\nThe Indus then flows through a gorge near Sukkur and the fertile plains region of Sindh, forming a large delta region between the border of Gujarat, India and Pakistan, finally terminating in the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi, Pakistan. During floods, Indus river water flows in to Indian part of Great Rann of Kutch. Thus Gujarat state of India is also a riparian state of Indus river as Rann of Kutch area lying west of Kori Creek in the state is part of the Indus River Delta.\n\nThe Sutlej, along with all of the Punjab rivers, is thought to have drained east into the Ganges prior to 5 mya.\n\nThere is substantial geologic evidence to indicate that prior to 1700 BC, and perhaps much earlier, the Sutlej was an important tributary of the Ghaggar-Hakra River (thought to be the legendary Sarasvati River) rather than the Indus, with various authors putting the redirection from 2500 to 2000 BC, from 5000 to 3000 BC, or before 8000 BC. Geologists believe that tectonic activity created elevation changes which redirected the flow of Sutlej from the southeast to the southwest. If the diversion of the river occurred recently (about 4000 years ago), it may have been responsible for the Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) drying up, causing desertification of Cholistan and the eastern part of the modern state of Sindh, and the abandonment of Harappan settlements along the Ghaggar. However, the Sutlej may have already been captured by the Indus thousands of years earlier.\n\nThere is some evidence that the high rate of erosion caused by the modern Sutlej River has influenced the local faulting and rapidly exhumed rocks above Rampur. This would be similar to, but on a much smaller scale than, the exhumation of rocks by the Indus River in Nanga Parbat, Pakistan. The Sutlej River also exposes a doubled inverted metamorphic gradient.\n\nThere has been a proposal to build a 214 km long heavy freight and irrigation canal, to be known as the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) to connect the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers. The project is intended to connect the Ganges, which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west, via Pakistan. When completed, the SYL would enable inland shipping from India's east coast to its west coast (on the Arabian sea) without having to round the southern tip of India by sea, vastly shortening shipping distances, alleviating pressures on seaports, avoiding sea hazards, creating business opportunities along the route, raising real estate values, raising tax revenue, and establishing important commercial links and providing jobs for north-central India's large population. However, the proposal has met with obstacles and has been referred to the Supreme Court of India. To augment nearly 100 tmcft water availability for the needs of this link canal, Tso Moriri lake/Lingdi Nadi (a tributary of Tso Moriri lake) waters can be diverted to the Sutlej basin by digging a 10 km long gravity canal to connect to the Ungti Chu river.\n\nThe Upper Sutlej Valley, called Langqên Zangbo in Tibet, was once known as the Garuda Valley by the Zhangzhung, the ancient civilization of western Tibet. The Garuda Valley was the centre of their empire, which stretched many miles into the nearby Himalayas. The Zhangzhung built a towering palace in the Upper Sutlej Valley called Kyunglung, the ruins of which still exist today near the village of Moincêr, southwest of Mount Kailash (Mount Ti-se). Eventually, the Zhangzhung were conquered by the Tibetan Empire.\n\nThe boundaries of Greater Nepal extended westward to beyond Satluj River until the tide turned in 1809 and Kangra king repulsed Gorkha army eastward with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\n\nToday, the Sutlej Valley is inhabited by nomadic descendants of the Zhangzhung, who live in tiny villages of yak herders.\n\nThe Sutlej was the main medium of transportation for the kings of that time. In the early 18th century, it was used to transport devdar woods for Bilaspur district, Hamirpur district, and other places along the Sutlej's banks.\n\nOf four rivers (Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra and Karnali/Ganges) mythically flowing out of holy Lake Manasarovar, the Sutlej is actually connected by channels that are dry most of the time.\n\n\n\n\n * List of rivers of India\n * List of rivers of Pakistan\n * Cis-Sutlej states\n * Sulemanki Headworks\n * https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330736963_Study_of_Toxic_Elements_in_River_Water_and_Wetland_Using_Water_Hyacinth_Eichhornia_crassipes_as_Pollution_Monitor\n\n* Sutlej basin marked on OpenStreetMap.",

It is one of six rivers of the Indus System in Punjab region (Punjab means \"Five Rivers\"). The waters of Ravi are allocated to India under Indus Water Treaty.\n\nUnder the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the waters of the Ravi and five other rivers are divided between India and Pakistan. Subsequently, the Indus Basin Project has been developed in Pakistan and many inter-basin water transfers, irrigation, hydropower and multipurpose projects have been built in India.\n\nAccording to ancient history traced to Vedas, the Ravi River was known as Iravati (also spelt Eeraveti; इरावती, परुष्णि) The Ravi was known as Parushani or Iravati to Indians in Vedic times and as Hydraotes   to the Ancient Greeks.\n\nPart of the battle of the ten kings was fought on a River, which according to Yaska (Nirukta 9.26) refers to the Iravati River (Ravi River) in the Punjab.\n\nThe Ravi River, a transboundary river of India and Pakistan, is an integral part of the Indus River Basin and forms the headwaters of the Indus basin. The waters of the Ravi River drain into the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean) through the Indus River in Pakistan. The river rises in the Bara Bhangal, District Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, India. The river drains a total catchment area of 14442 km2 in India after flowing for a length of 720 km. Flowing westward, it is hemmed by the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges, forming a triangular zone.\n\n;Source reach The Ravi River originates in the Himalayas in the Multhan tehsil of Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. It follows a north-westerly course and is a perennial river. It is the smallest of the five Punjab rivers that rises from glacier fields at an elevation of 14000 ft, on the southern side of the Mid Himalayas. It flows through Barabhangal, Bara Bansu and Chamba districts. It flows in rapids in its initial reaches with boulders seen scattered in the bed of the river. The Ravi River in this reach flows in a gorge with a river bed slope of 183 ft/mi and is mostly fed by snow melt, as this region lies in a rain shadow. Two of its major tributaries, the Budhil and Nai or Dhona join 40 mi downstream from its source. The Budhil River rises in Lahul range of hills and is sourced from the Manimahesh Kailash Peak and the Manimahesh Lake, at an elevation of 4080 m, and both are Hindu pilgrimage sites. The entire length of Budhil is 45 mi where it has a bed slope of 314 ft/mi. It flows through the ancient capital of Bharmwar, now known as Bharmour in Himachal Pradesh. During 1858–1860, the Raja of Bharmour had considered the Budhil valley as an excellent source of Deodar trees for supply to the British Raj. However, a part of the forest surrounding the temple was considered sacred and declared a reserved area. The second tributary, the Nai, rises at Kali Debi pass, and flows for 30 mi, with a bed slope of 366 ft/mi, from its source at Trilokinath to its confluence with the Ravi. This valley was also exploited for its forest wealth during the English period. Another major tributary that joins the Ravi River, just below Bharmour, the old capital of Chamba, is the Seul River from the northern direction. The valley formed by the river was also exploited for its rich timber trees. However, the valley has large terraces, which are very fertile and known as \"the garden of Chamba\". crops grown here supply grains to the capital region and to Dalhousie town and its surrounding areas. One more major tributary that joins the Ravi River near Bissoli is the Siawa. This river was also exploited for its forest resources, (controlled by the then Raja of Chamba) originating from the Jammu region. The valley is also formed by another major tributary that joins Seul River, the Baira-Nalla. Its sub-basin is in the Chamba district, located above Tissa. Baira drains the southern slopes of the Pir Panjal Range. The valley has an elevation variation between 5321 m and 2693 m.\n\nTant Gari is another small tributary that rises from the subsidiary hill ranges of the Pir Panjal Range east of Bharmour. The valley formed by this stream is U-shaped with a river bed scattered with boulders and glacial morainic deposits. ;Main Ravi River\n\nThe main Ravi River flows through the base of Dalhousie hill, past the Chamba town. It is at an elevation of 2807 ft (where a long wooden bridge existed to cross the Ravi River). It flows into the south-west, near Dalhousie, and then cuts a gorge in the Dhauladhar Range, before entering the Punjab plain near Madhopur and Pathankot. It then flows along the Indo–Pak border for 80 km before entering Pakistan and joining the Chenab River. The total length of the river is about 725 km.\n\nUjh River is another major tributary of the Ravi River. Its source is in the Kailash mountains at an elevation of 4300 m, close to the Bhaderwah Mountains in Jammu district. After flowing for 100 km, it joins Ravi at Nainkot in Pakistan.\n\nAs the Ravi flows past Lahore in Pakistan (26 km below Amritsar in India) it is called \"The river of Lahore\" since that city is on its eastern bank. After passing through Lahore the river takes a turn at Kamlia and then debouches into the Chenab River, south of the town of Ahmadpur Sial. On its western bank is the town of Shahdara Bagh with the tomb of Jahangir and the Tomb of Noor Jahan.\n\n;Change of river course According to satellite imagery studies carried out over a period of 20 years (between 1972–1973 and 1991–1993), the river coursing along the India–Pakistan border meanders substantially in the alluvial plains of the Amritsar, pathankot and Gurdaspur districts of Punjab. This has resulted in successive damage in the Indian Territory as a result of the river changing its course towards India. The reason attributed to this change in the course of the river is massive river training structures/bunds constructed by Pakistan in its part of the river, close to the old course of the river. The shift in the course of the river is reported to be 4.8 km towards India.\n\n;River water pollution\n\nIn the trans-boundary Ravi River flowing from India to Pakistan, in urban areas of Lahore the pollution levels in the river discharge are reportedly very high, which is attributed to careless disposal of large amount of industrial and agricultural waste water and faulty drainage systems in both countries. A 72 km stretch of the Ravi River from Lahore Siphon to Baloki headworks indicates heavy contamination of the water and sediment with Cd, Cr, Pt and Cu. The river sediments are highly contaminated and have become secondary source for pollution of the river water, even though some control over unauthorised discharges into the river have been checked. Hence, measures to check metal re-mobilization from sediments into the river flows needs attention. The worst affected drainage is the Hadharaam drain, a tributary of the Ravi River. It is also a trans-border problem involving both India and Pakistan. A UNDP funded a special programme was launched in 2006 to address the issue in both countries.\n\nThe Ravi valley in its upper reaches has Deodar, walnut, Quercus ilex, mulberry, alder, edible pine (Pinus gerardiana), twisted cypress (Cupressus torulosa), chinar (Platanus orientalis), daphne papyracea, cedrela serata, and sisso, olive and kakkar (raus).\n\nThe waters of the Ravi River are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty, signed by India and Pakistan. Within India, the river is under the jurisdiction of the riparian states of Punjab and Himachal, and non-riparian states of Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir and Rajasthan, but the management is presided by the Supreme Court of India and the Ravi Beas Tribunal, set up in 1986 for the purpose.\n\n;Pre-partition utilisation On the Ravi River, the earliest project built was the Madhopur Headworks, in 1902. It is a run-of-the river project (no storage envisaged) to divert flows through the Upper Bari Doab Canal (also known as Central Bari Doab Canal) to provide irrigation in the command area of the then unified India. Government of India has assessed the pre-partition use in India (Punjab) at 1476000 acre.ft. Prior to partition, it irrigated 335,000 hectares of land in Gurdaspur, Amritsar and Lahore districts.\n\n;Hydropower The Hydropower potential of Ravi River system has been assessed at 2294 MW. The hydropower potential developed since the 1980s is through installation of Baira Suil Hydroelelectric Power Project of 198 MW capacity, the Chamera-I of 540 MW capacity commissioned in 1994, the Ranjitsagar Multipurpose Project (600 MW) completed in 1999 and the Chamera-II of 300 MW capacity in the upstream of Chamera-I commissioned in 2004. As the Ravi river is located at lower level, Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers water can be diverted to this river for harnessing huge hydro power potential.\n\n;Multipurpose development The major multipurpose project (Irrigation, Hydropower, Flood Control, development of Fisheries, Tourism and so forth) built on the river is the Ranjit Sagar Dam (also known as Thein dam as it is in Thein village). The left bank is in Punjab and the right bank is in Jammu and Kashmir. It is located on the main stem of the Ravi River, about 24 km upstream of Madhopur Headworks (built during pre-partition time). The project is an outcome of the development plan conceived for the use of the waters of three eastern rivers allocated to India under the Indus Treaty, namely the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi, for irrigation, hydropower generation and other consumptive uses.\n\nA proposal for building a storage dam on the Ravi River was initially planned in 1912, envisaging a 200 ft high dam. A committee later conducted a survey of the area, but it was not until 1954 that geologists fully inspected the project area. In 1957, a storage Dam was proposed on the Ravi River for irrigation purposes only. The power generation aspect was not considered then. It was only in 1964 that the project was conceived for multipurpose development and submitted to Government of India for approval. Finally, in April 1982, the project was approved for construction by the Government of India.\n\nThe project, as built now, has a 160 m high earth gravel shell dam with a gross irrigation potential of 348000 ha of land and power generation of 600 MW (4 units of 150 MW capacity each).\n\nThe geomorpohological setting of the river basin, which has a large number of terraces between Dhauladhar and Pir Panjal ranges, is attributed to the truly Himalayan characteristics of the river reflecting the \"cis-Himalayan tectonic; structural, lithological and climatic conditions. Obviously it is different from the antecedent Indus and Sutlej\".\n\nThe upper reaches of the main Indus River and its tributaries lie in India whereas the lower reaches are in Pakistan. Following the partition of India in August 1947, a dispute arose between India and Pakistan on sharing of the waters of the Indus River Basin. The dispute was resolved with the intervention of the World Bank and a treaty was signed in 1960 on sharing of the Indus waters between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe Indus System of Rivers comprises the three Western Rivers in the Indus, the Jhelum and Chenab together with three Eastern Rivers; the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi. To establish the ownership of these waters, an Indus Water Treaty was signed between India and Pakistan on 1 April 1960, under monitoring of the World Bank. The treaty, under Article 5.1, envisages the sharing of waters of the rivers Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Jhelum and Chenab which join the Indus River on its left bank (eastern side) in Pakistan. According to this treaty, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, which constitute the eastern rivers, are allocated for exclusive use by India before they enter Pakistan. However, a transition period of 10 years was permitted in which India was bound to supply water to Pakistan from these rivers until Pakistan was able to build the canal system for utilisation of waters of Jhelum, Chenab and the Indus itself, allocated to it under the treaty. Similarly, Pakistan has exclusive use of the Western Rivers Jhelum, Chenab and Indus but with some stipulations for development of projects on these rivers in India. Pakistan also received one-time financial compensation for the loss of water from the Eastern rivers. Since 31 March 1970, after the 10-year moratorium, India has secured full rights for use of the waters of the three rivers allocated to it. The treaty resulted in partitioning of the rivers rather than sharing of their waters.\n\nUnder this treaty, the two countries also agreed to exchange data and co-operate in matters related to the treaty. For this purpose, treaty envisaged creation of the Permanent Indus Commission, with a commissioner appointed by each country. The Indus Waters Treaty is the only International treaty that has been implemented over the last 60 years with due diligence and sincerity by both India and Pakistan, in spite of many wars fought between the two countries (the treaty was not revoked either by India or Pakistan during the 1965 or the 1971 war).\n\nEven prior to the partition of India in August 1947, India had developed projects on the river Ravi and Beas River system. When the treaty was under debate, India had taken advance action to develop the three rivers, which were eventually allocated to it under the treaty. According to a directive of the Government of India, planning for development of the Ravi and Beas rivers was initiated concurrently with the treaty negotiations, which involved four riparian states of Punjab, PEPSU (this was merged with Punjab and subsequently Punjab was divided, and additionally the Haryana state was created), Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) within the ambit of the already developed Bhakra Nangal Dam project on the Sutlej River. A review of the flows in the two river systems revealed that prior to partition of the country and up to the time of the signing of the Indus Treaty, 3130000 acre.ft of water was used by major irrigation systems such as the Upper Bari Doab Canal System (1959) and the Lower Bari Doab Canal System (1915). The unused flow in the two river systems was assessed at 15580000 acre.ft, which was planned to be developed by the four states of J&K, PEPSU, Punjab and Rajasthan. However, with the merger of PEPSU with Punjab and subsequent bifurcation of Punjab into two states, a dispute arose on the allocation of Ravi and Beas waters for which a tribunal was set up under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act.\n\nAs a counter claim to the exclusive claims of Punjab, Haryana claims that a small part of Haryana state lying north in Panchkula district is part of Sutlej river basin area in addition to Punjab and Himachal Pradesh in India. Thus Haryana claims to be a riparian state of Indus river basin.\n\nFollowing the reorganisation of the state of Punjab in 1966, Haryana State was created. This was followed by a notification by the Government of India dated 24 March 1976 allocating the surplus waters between Punjab and Haryana in due consideration of the powers conferred by Sub Section (I) of Section 78 of the Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 (31 of 1966). The allocation was challenged in the Supreme Court by Haryana. A tripartite agreement followed on 31 December 1981, based on the revised mean annual flows from the flow series of 1921–60 assessed as 20560000 acre.ft—including prepartition use of 3130000 acre.ft and transit losses in the Madhopur Beas Link of 260000 acre.ft—vis-a-vis the figure of 15850000 acre.ft assessed in earlier allocation, which was based on the flow series of 1921–45. The revised assessed surplus supplies of 17170000 acre.ft (from flow and storage) was allocated as:\n\nHowever, the legality of this agreement was challenged by Punjab. This was followed by the Punjab accord signed by the then Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi and Sant Harchand Singh Longowal, President of the Shiromani Akali Dal, on 24 July 1985. This accord stipulated that\n\nFollowing the above accord, Ravi & Beas Waters Tribunal (RBWT) came to be set up in April 1986, in pursuance of paragraphs 9.1 & 9.2 of Punjab Settlement (Rajiv-Longowal Accord, 1985) inter-alia to adjudicate the claims of Punjab and Haryana in Ravi-Beas waters. The Terms of Reference was set and also the time for submission of the report. The Tribunal submitted its report on 30 January 1987. However, the report was contested as Rajasthan also moved an application \"seeking explanation and guidance regarding the report of this Ravi Beas waters Tribunal, 1987\". The Tribunal is further examining the matter. It is yet to submit its further report to the Government on the pleas submitted by the party States and the Central Government also seeking explanation/guidance on its earlier report. In the mean time, a Presidential reference on Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004 is pending before the Honorable Supreme Court. Hence, the further hearings of the Tribunal and its final report are now enjoined on the outcome of the Supreme Court hearing of the Presidential reference.\n\nPunjab has not allowed the construction of the SYL and will not allow it ever. All river waters in the world are allocate on the basis of riparian law, however in this case a grave injustice is being done to Punjab. As stated above J&K has started utilizing Ravi water and does not need Punjab s consent. Punjab needs to implement the same formula of utilizing water for its exclusive usage instead of letting it flow to Haryana and Rajasthan who instead of being thankful to Punjab have started demanding its share as well.\n\nPunjab is contemplating to construct 206 MW Shahpurkandi dam project hydro electric project on the Ravi river between Ranjitsagar dam and Madhopur head works. This stretch of the river is forming boundary between J & K state and Punjab state. Since Punjab had unilaterally exited from the earlier water sharing agreements, J & K state refused the project construction. Also J & K state is going ahead with the construction of Ravi canal originating from Basantpur to irrigate 133000 acre of land in Jammu region. This canal would draw river water by pumping the water released downstream from the Rangitsagar reservoir for which J & K state is not required to take consent from Punjab as it is not bound by earlier river water sharing agreements.\n\nTransfer of surplus water from one basin to another, termed as interbasin water transfer has been effectively implemented on the Ravi River. The surplus waters of the Ravi River have been transferred directly first to the Beas River through the Ravi-Beas Link. A further link from Beas River to the Sutlej River by the Beas Sutlej Link augments storage of the Bhakra reservoir in India.\n\n\n * Rivers of Jammu and Kashmir\n * Sapta Sindhu\n * Indus Waters Treaty\n * Ranjit Sagar Dam Project\n\n\n\n*\n * Indian climate change from Harappa period.\n * Indus river’s transition.",

      "title": "Jhelum River",
      "description": "The Jhelum River (undefined, Punjabi: ਜਿਹਲਮ/جہلم, Kashmiri: Vyeth (/व्यथा)) is a river in northern India and eastern Pakistan. It is the westernmost of the five rivers of the Punjab region, and passes through the Kashmir Valley. It is a tributary of the Indus River and has a total length of about 725 km.\n\n\n\nAnjum Sultan Shahbaz recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as:\n\nOne suggestion is that in ancient days Jhelumabad was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is reportedly derived from the words Jal(pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus refers to the waters of a river (flowing besides the city) which have their origins in the snow-capped Himalayas. However, some writers believe that when \"Dara-e-Azam\" reached a certain place on the river bank after winning many battles, he fixed his flag at that place and called it \"Ja-e-Alam\" which means \"Place of the Flag\". With the passage of time it became Jhelum from \"Ja-e-Alam\".''\n\nThe Sanskrit name of this river is Vitasta. The river's name is derived from an apocryphal legend regarding the origin of the river as explained in Nilamata Purana. Goddess Parvati was requested by sage Kasyapa to come to Kashmir for purification of the land from evil practices and impurities of Pisachas living there. Goddess Parvati then assumed the form of a river in the Nether World. Then Lord Shiva made a stroke with his spear near the abode of Nila (Verinag Spring). By that stroke of the spear, Goddess Parvati came out of the Nether World. Shiva himself named her as Vitasta. He had excavated with the spear a ditch measuring one Vitasti (a particular measure of length defined either as a long span between the extended thumb and little finger, or as the distance between the wrist and the tip of the fingers, and said to be about 9 inches), through which the river - gone to the Nether World - had come out, so she was given the name Vitasta by him.\n\nThe river Jhelum is called Vitastā in the Rigveda and Hydaspes (Υδάσπης) by the ancient Greeks. The Vitastā (वितस्ता, fem., also, Vetastā) is mentioned as one of the major rivers by the holy scriptures — the Rigveda. It has been speculated that the Vitastā must have been one of the seven rivers (sapta-sindhu) mentioned so many times in the Rigveda. The name survives in the Kashmiri name for this river as Vyeth. According to the major religious work Srimad Bhagavatam, the Vitastā is one of the many transcendental rivers flowing through land of Bharata, or ancient India.\n\nAlexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in BC 326 at the Battle of the Hydaspes River where he defeated the Indian king, Porus. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city \"on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes\", which he named Bukephala (or Bucephala) to honour his famous horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus which was buried in Jalalpur Sharif. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum City. According to a historian of Gujrat district, Mansoor Behzad Butt, Bukephalus was buried in Jalalpur Sharif, but the people of Mandi Bahauddin, a district close to Jehlum, believed that their tehsil Phalia was named after Bucephalus, Alexander's dead horse. They say that the name Phalia was the distortion of the word Bucephala. The waters of the Jhelum are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is working on a hydropower project on a tributary of Jhelum river to establish first-use rights on the river water over Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\nThe river was regarded as a god by the ancient Greeks, as were most mountains and streams; the poet Nonnus in the Dionysiaca (section 26, line 350) makes the Hydaspes a titan-descended god, the son of the sea-god Thaumas and the cloud-goddess Elektra. He was the brother of Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, and half-brother to the Harpies, the snatching winds. Since the river is in a country foreign to the ancient Greeks, it is not clear whether they named the river after the god, or whether the god Hydaspes was named after the river.\n\nThe river Jhelum rises from Verinag Spring situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of Kashmir. It's joined by its tributaries Lidder River at Mirgund Khannabal and Sind River at Shadipora in Kashmir Valley. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular lake before entering Pakistan through a deep narrow gorge. The Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it, at Domel Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of the Kaghan valley. It also connects with rest of Pakistan and Pakistani Kashmir on Kohala Bridge east of Circle Bakote. It is then joined by the Poonch river, and flows into the Mangla Dam reservoir in the district of Mirpur. The Jhelum enters the Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan's Punjab, forming the boundary between the Chaj and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab at Trimmu in District Jhang. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.\n\n• Wular Lake\n\n• Dal Lake\n\n• Manasbal Lake\n\n• Gangabal Lake\n\n• Nigeen Lake\n\n• Anchar Lake\n\nThe river has rich power generation potential in India. Water control structures are being built as a result of the Indus Basin Project, including the following:\n * Mangla Dam, completed in 1967, is one of the largest earthfill dams in the world, with a storage capacity of 5900000 acre.ft\n * Rasul Barrage, constructed in 1967, has a maximum flow of 850,000 ft³/s (24,000 m³/s).\n * Trimmu Barrage, constructed in 1939 some 20 km from Jhang Sadar at the confluence with the Chenab, has maximum discharge capacity of 645,000 ft³/s (18,000 m³/s).\n * Haranpur (Victoria Bridge) Constructed in 1933 Approximate 5 km from Malakwal near Chak Nizam Village. Its length is 1 km mainly used by Pakistan Railways but there is a passage for light vehicles, motorcycles, cycles and pedestrians at one side.\n * Uri Dam with 480 MW Hydro electric station is located in Jammu and Kashmir state.\n * Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant 330 MW Hydro electric station is located in Jammu and Kashmir state\n\n\n * The Upper Jhelum Canal runs from Mangla Dam to the Chenab.\n * The Rasul-Qadirabad Link Canal runs from the Rasul Barrage to the Chenab.\n * The Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal runs from the Chashma Barrage on the Indus River to the Jhelum river downstream of Rasul Barrage.

It drains much of the water of Pothohar. It starts near the small village of Bun in the foothills of Patriata and Murree. It provides water to Simly Dam, which is the water reservoir for Islamabad. Near Pharwala Fort it cuts through a high mountain range, a wonderful natural phenomenon called Soan Cut. No stream can cut such a high mountain, which proves that the Soan was there before the formation of this range. And as the mountain rose through millions of years, the stream continued its path by cutting the rising mountain. Ling stream, following a relatively long course through Lehtrar and Kahuta falls in the Soan near Sihala on southern side of Village Gagri/Bhandar.\n\nIslamabad Highway crosses this stream near Sihala where the famous Kak Pul bridge is constructed over it. The Ling Stream joins the Soan river just before the Kak Pul. Two other famous streams, the Korang River joins it just before the Soan Bridge and Lai stream, joins this stream after the Soan Bridge. After following a tortuous path along a big curve, the stream reaches Kalabagh proposed Dam Site close to Pirpiyahi where it falls into the Indus river. There is a famous railway station by the name of Sohan and a beautiful railway bridge very close to it. This relatively small stream is more than 250 kilometers long. Due to its mountainous course and shallow bed, it is hardly used for irrigation purposes. There are many species of fish in this river like China Rahu, Mahasher, Snakehead, Balm and Catfish are the main species of fish in this stream and Kingfisher birds hunt here too. In addition, there are many species of tortoises and turtles. The marine life of this river has been endangered due to drainage of chemicals of Sihala Industrial State and effluent water of Rawalpindi city into it. There was a time when peoples used to fish in this stream with nets and hooks and bring home handsome catch but now, not only the above species of fish have diminished but also peoples avoid to eat Soan River's fish as it feeds on contaminated water, which can cause different diseases. Ministry of Environment must take action and treat the effluent water of Rawalpindi city before releasing it into Soan River and also punish and fine those industrialists who are releasing chemicals and other industrial waste into the river and destroying the beautiful marine life of Soan River.\n\nThe oldest evidence of life in Pakistan has been found in Soan River valley.

The valley is a thickly wooded region with an elevation ranging between 4000 ft and 7500 ft, the mountain peaks on either side reaching 17000 ft. Neelum Valley is 144 km long.\n\nMost of the valley is taken up by the Neelum District(undefined). The district is bordered on the south-west by Muzaffarabad District, which also encompasses the lower reaches of the valley; to the north-west beyond the mountains lies the Kaghan Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mansehra District; to the north and north-east are the Diamer, Astore and Skardu districts of Gilgit-Baltistan. To the south and east are the Kupwara and Bandipora districts of Indian Kashmir. The Line of Control runs through the valley – either across the mountains to the south-east, or in places right along the river, with several villages on the left bank falling on the Indian side of the border.\n\nNeelum District was part of Muzaffarabad District until 2005. It is made up of two tehsils: Athmuqam, which contains the district headquarters, and Sharda. Neelum District is the largest district of Azad Kashmir by area. The valley extends for approximately 200 kilometers along the Neelum River. This is a generally poor region, reliant on subsistence agriculture and handicrafts, with tourism growing in importance in recent years. According to the Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2015, Neelum is ranked 33 out of 148 districts in terms of education. For facilities and infrastructure, the district is ranked 136 out of 148.\n\nSeveral languages are spoken natively in the district. The predominant one is Hindko. It is the language of wider communication in the area, and is spoken at a native or near-native level by almost all members of the other language communities, many of whom are abandoning their language and shifting to Hindko. This language is usually called Parmi (or Parimi, Pārim), a name that likely originated in the Kashmiri word apārim 'from the other side', which was the term used by the Kashmiris of the Vale of Kashmir to refer to the highlanders, who spoke this language. The language is also sometimes known as Pahari, although it bears closer resemblance to the Hindko of neighbouring Kaghan Valley than to the Pahari spoken in the Murree Hills. Unlike other varieties of Hindko, Pahari or Punjabi, it has preserved the voiced aspirated consonants at the start of the word: for example gha 'grass' vs. Punjabi kà, where the aspiration and voicing have been lost giving rise to a low tone on the following vowel. This sound change however is currently spreading here as well, but it has so far only affected the villages situated along the Neelam highway. This variety of Hindko is also spoken in nearby areas of India-administered Kashmir. Since Partition, the language varieties on either side of the Line of Control have diverged in a number of ways. For example, in the Neelam Valley there is a higher proportion of Urdu loanwords, while the variety spoken across the Line of Control has retained more traditional Hindko words.\n\nThe second most widely spoken language of the Neelam Valley is Kashmiri. It is the majority language in at least a dozen or so villages, and in about half of these it is it the sole mother tongue. It is closer to the variety spoken in northern Kashmir (particularly Kupwara) than to the Kashmiri of the city of Muzaffarabad.\n\nThe third largest ethnic, though not linguistic, group are the Gujjars, whose villages are scattered throughout the valley. Most of them have switched to Hindko, but a few communities continue using the Gujari language at home. Gujari is more consistently maintained among the Bakarwal, who travel into the valley (and beyond into Gilgit-Baltistan) with their herds in the summer and who spend the winters in the lower parts of Azad Kashmir and in Punjab.\n\nIn the upper end of the valley there are two distinct communities speaking two different varieties of Shina (locally sometimes called Dardi). One of them is found at Taobutt and the nearby village of Karimabad (formerly known as Sutti) near the border with India. Its speakers claim that their variety of Shina is close to the one spoken further up the valley in Indian Gurez. The community is bilingual in Kashmiri and is culturally closer to the neighbouring Kashmiri communities than to the other Shina group, who inhabit the large village of Phulwei 35 km downstream. The Shina people of Phullwei claim to have originally come from Nait near Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nA Pashto dialect is spoken in two villages (Dhaki and Changnar) that are situated on the Line of Control. Because of cross-border firing since the early 1990s, there has been large-scale migration away from these villages. The local dialect is not completely intelligible with the ones spoken in the rest of Pakistan.\n\nOne language that is unique to the Neelam Valley is the endangered Kundal Shahi. It is spoken by some of the inhabitants of the Kundal Shahi village near Athmuqam.\n\nAdditionally, Urdu is spoken by the formally educated and, like English, is used as a medium of instruction in schools.\n\n\n\nTourist attractions include:\n * Arang Kel\n * Athmuqam\n * Chitta Katha Lake\n * Dhani Waterfall\n * Dowarian\n * Ratti Gali Lake\n * Halmat\n * Kel\n * Keran\n * Kutton\n * Sharda\n * Taobat\n\nNeelum Valley has three sub-valleys within itself.

The district, which had been part of Poonch District, was created in 1988.\n\nThe district is bounded by Muzaffarabad District to the north, Poonch district to the south, and Poonch district of the Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir to the east; it is bounded by the Punjab, Rawalpindi District and Abbottabad District of Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province to the west. The total area of the district is 770 square kilometers. Bagh District is linked to Muzaffarabad by two roads, one via Sudhan Gali (80 km) and the other through Kohala (97 km). It is situated 46 km from Rawalakot. The district's headquarters is located at Bagh. It is said that a bagh (garden) was set up by the landowner where the premises of the Forest Department are now located. As a result, the area that is now the district headquarters was named “Bagh”.\n\nThere is an archaeological site located in Bagh called Bagh Fort.\n\nPrior to 1947, Bagh was a tehsil in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n\n\nThe district of Bagh is sub-divided into 2 tehsils:\n * Bagh Tehsil\n * Dhirkot Tehsil\n\n\n\nTopographically, the entire Bagh district is a mountainous area, generally sloping from northeast to south-west. The area falls in the lesser Himalayas zone. The main range in the district is Pir-Panjal.\n\nThe Haji-Pir Pass is situated at the height of 3421 meters above sea level. The general elevation is between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The mountains are generally covered with coniferous forests. Mahl Nala (in the Bagh sub-division) and Betar Nala (in the Haveli sub-division) are the two main streams. However, numerous other rivulets flow in the district.\n\nThe climate of the district varies with altitude. The temperature generally remains between 2 °C to 40 °C. The main eastern part of the district is very cold in winter and moderate in summer. However, the lower valleys, the localities bordering Bagh at Kohala and its adjoining areas (Mongbajri and Ajra-Bagh) remain cold in winter and hot in summer. May, June and July are the hottest months. Maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are about 40 °C and 22 °C respectively. December, January and February are the coldest months. The maximum temperature in January is about 16 °C and minimum temperature is 3 °C respectively. Annual rainfall is about 1500 mm.\n\nThe total population of the district according to the 2017 census was 371,919.\n\nThe major language of Azad Kashmir is Pahari. The Pahari dialect spoken in Bagh is closely related to the dialect spoken to the north in Muzaffarabad (84% shared basic vocabulary) and with the core Pahari varieties spoken to the south(west) in the Galyat region around Murree (86–88%).\n\nAccording to Pakistan District Education Ranking 2017, a report by Alif Ailaan, the district of Bagh is ranked at number 5 nationally in the ranking related to education, with an education score of 73.99. The learning score is at 85.42 and gender parity score of 88.32,\n\nThe school infrastructure score of Bagh is 28.32, giving Bagh a national rank of 126. School infrastructure is a major problem in all of Kashmir. Access to schools, schools being far away is also a reason why there are less number of enrollments, especially after completing primary school.\n\nThe city of Bagh, like other areas of the district, was heavily damaged in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Sixty percent of the buildings collapsed. Thousands of people died and many more found themselves homeless. In the aftermath of the earthquake, NATO came to the district to help with reconstruction and clearing. There was a report that an entire village was wiped out in the district. The U.S., through Pakistan, distributed vouchers so people could buy water and food.\n\n\n * Bagh Azad Jammu and Kashmir Official Portal\n * District Profile – Bagh Earthquake Reconstruction & Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) 2007",

      "title": "Jhelum River",
      "description": "The Jhelum River (undefined, Punjabi: ਜਿਹਲਮ/جہلم, Kashmiri: Vyeth (/व्यथा)) is a river in northern India and eastern Pakistan. It is the westernmost of the five rivers of the Punjab region, and passes through the Kashmir Valley. It is a tributary of the Indus River and has a total length of about 725 km.\n\n\n\nAnjum Sultan Shahbaz recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as:\n\nOne suggestion is that in ancient days Jhelumabad was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is reportedly derived from the words Jal(pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus refers to the waters of a river (flowing besides the city) which have their origins in the snow-capped Himalayas. However, some writers believe that when \"Dara-e-Azam\" reached a certain place on the river bank after winning many battles, he fixed his flag at that place and called it \"Ja-e-Alam\" which means \"Place of the Flag\". With the passage of time it became Jhelum from \"Ja-e-Alam\".''\n\nThe Sanskrit name of this river is Vitasta. The river's name is derived from an apocryphal legend regarding the origin of the river as explained in Nilamata Purana. Goddess Parvati was requested by sage Kasyapa to come to Kashmir for purification of the land from evil practices and impurities of Pisachas living there. Goddess Parvati then assumed the form of a river in the Nether World. Then Lord Shiva made a stroke with his spear near the abode of Nila (Verinag Spring). By that stroke of the spear, Goddess Parvati came out of the Nether World. Shiva himself named her as Vitasta. He had excavated with the spear a ditch measuring one Vitasti (a particular measure of length defined either as a long span between the extended thumb and little finger, or as the distance between the wrist and the tip of the fingers, and said to be about 9 inches), through which the river - gone to the Nether World - had come out, so she was given the name Vitasta by him.\n\nThe river Jhelum is called Vitastā in the Rigveda and Hydaspes (Υδάσπης) by the ancient Greeks. The Vitastā (वितस्ता, fem., also, Vetastā) is mentioned as one of the major rivers by the holy scriptures — the Rigveda. It has been speculated that the Vitastā must have been one of the seven rivers (sapta-sindhu) mentioned so many times in the Rigveda. The name survives in the Kashmiri name for this river as Vyeth. According to the major religious work Srimad Bhagavatam, the Vitastā is one of the many transcendental rivers flowing through land of Bharata, or ancient India.\n\nAlexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in BC 326 at the Battle of the Hydaspes River where he defeated the Indian king, Porus. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city \"on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes\", which he named Bukephala (or Bucephala) to honour his famous horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus which was buried in Jalalpur Sharif. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum City. According to a historian of Gujrat district, Mansoor Behzad Butt, Bukephalus was buried in Jalalpur Sharif, but the people of Mandi Bahauddin, a district close to Jehlum, believed that their tehsil Phalia was named after Bucephalus, Alexander's dead horse. They say that the name Phalia was the distortion of the word Bucephala. The waters of the Jhelum are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is working on a hydropower project on a tributary of Jhelum river to establish first-use rights on the river water over Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\nThe river was regarded as a god by the ancient Greeks, as were most mountains and streams; the poet Nonnus in the Dionysiaca (section 26, line 350) makes the Hydaspes a titan-descended god, the son of the sea-god Thaumas and the cloud-goddess Elektra. He was the brother of Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, and half-brother to the Harpies, the snatching winds. Since the river is in a country foreign to the ancient Greeks, it is not clear whether they named the river after the god, or whether the god Hydaspes was named after the river.\n\nThe river Jhelum rises from Verinag Spring situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of Kashmir. It's joined by its tributaries Lidder River at Mirgund Khannabal and Sind River at Shadipora in Kashmir Valley. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular lake before entering Pakistan through a deep narrow gorge. The Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it, at Domel Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of the Kaghan valley. It also connects with rest of Pakistan and Pakistani Kashmir on Kohala Bridge east of Circle Bakote. It is then joined by the Poonch river, and flows into the Mangla Dam reservoir in the district of Mirpur. The Jhelum enters the Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan's Punjab, forming the boundary between the Chaj and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab at Trimmu in District Jhang. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.\n\n• Wular Lake\n\n• Dal Lake\n\n• Manasbal Lake\n\n• Gangabal Lake\n\n• Nigeen Lake\n\n• Anchar Lake\n\nThe river has rich power generation potential in India. Water control structures are being built as a result of the Indus Basin Project, including the following:\n * Mangla Dam, completed in 1967, is one of the largest earthfill dams in the world, with a storage capacity of 5900000 acre.ft\n * Rasul Barrage, constructed in 1967, has a maximum flow of 850,000 ft³/s (24,000 m³/s).\n * Trimmu Barrage, constructed in 1939 some 20 km from Jhang Sadar at the confluence with the Chenab, has maximum discharge capacity of 645,000 ft³/s (18,000 m³/s).\n * Haranpur (Victoria Bridge) Constructed in 1933 Approximate 5 km from Malakwal near Chak Nizam Village. Its length is 1 km mainly used by Pakistan Railways but there is a passage for light vehicles, motorcycles, cycles and pedestrians at one side.\n * Uri Dam with 480 MW Hydro electric station is located in Jammu and Kashmir state.\n * Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant 330 MW Hydro electric station is located in Jammu and Kashmir state\n\n\n * The Upper Jhelum Canal runs from Mangla Dam to the Chenab.\n * The Rasul-Qadirabad Link Canal runs from the Rasul Barrage to the Chenab.\n * The Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal runs from the Chashma Barrage on the Indus River to the Jhelum river downstream of Rasul Barrage.

      "description": "The Neelum River (नीलम नदी, undefined), or Kishanganga (कृष्णगंगा नदी, undefined), is a river in the Kashmir region of India and Pakistan; it starts in the Indian city of Gurais and then merges with the Jhelum River near the Pakistani city of Muzaffarabad.\n\nThe Neelam River originates from Krishansar Lake in the vicinity of Sonamarg in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, and runs northwards to Badoab village in Tulail Valley where it meets a tributary from the Dras side. Then it runs westwards, parallel to the Kashmir Line of Control. It is fed by many glacial tributary streams on its way. It enters Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir in the Gurez sector of the Line of Control. Then it again runs west, parallel to the Line of Control, passing by Sharada. After Sharda, it bends to a southwesterly direction and runs along the Line of Control near Tithwal. Then it bends northwest again, making a wide arc to join the Jhelum River in Muzaffarabad.\n\nThe Neelum River is 245 kilometres long, it covers 50 kilometers in the Indian-administered Kashmir and the remaining 195 kilometres in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nThere are different kinds of fish found in abundance in the Neelum River. As the river almost entirely runs across the Line of Control, being the main cause for Kashmir conflict there is a feeling of uncertainty among the inhabitants, many of them have emigrated to safer places, which has left the river banks scarcely populous and kept the river in perfect conditions for growth of fish. The most famous among the different variety of fish found in Neelum River are:\n * Brown trout (Salmo trutta)\n * Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)\n * Snow trout (Schizothorax plagiostomus)\n * Shuddgurn\n * Anyour\n\nThe Neelum Valley is a Himalayan gorge in the Kashmir region, along which the Neelum River flows. This green and fertile valley is 250 km in length and stretches its way from Muzaffarabad all the way to Athmuqam and beyond to Taobutt. It is one of the most attractive tourists places, like Swat and Chitral, but due to poor road system is yet veiled to the outside world. This area was badly affected by the 2005 earthquake and was cut off from the outside world as the roads and paths were filled with rubble. Now construction of an international standard road is in progress.\n\nThere are two entrances for Neelum valley, one Neelum Road by Muzaffarabad and the other by Kaghan the Jalkhad Road. Generally Neelum valley starts just after Muzaffarabad but in political division the area from Muzaffarabad to Chelhana is named Kotla valley in election division. District Neelum starts from Chelhana and goes to Taobutt.\n\nShardadesh is a name for the drainage basin of the Neelum River.\n\nIn the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, the construction work on the 330 MW Kishanganga Hydroelectric Plant project has started, after being defunct for eighteen years. Recently, the project was awarded to Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) with a timeline of seven years. The 330 MW Kishanganga hydro-electric power project involves damming of Kishanganga or Neelam River and the proposed 37 metre reservoir will submerge some parts of the Gurez valley of Kashmir. The water of Kishen Ganga River will be diverted through a 24 kilometre tunnel dug through the mountains to Bandipore where it will join the Wular Lake and then Jhelum River.\n\nSimilarly, Pakistan is constructing the 969 MW Neelum–Jhelum Hydropower Plant; the country has placed the project in the hands of a Chinese consortium. Pakistan claims that the Indian dam project will violate the Indus Waters Treaty and has pursued formal arbitration proceedings against India over the matter.\n\n* Karen Village\n\n\n * The course of the Neelum River plotted on OpenStreetMap: part 1,  part 2\n * Neelum Valley.zoomshare\n * Neelum Valley Official",

It is called 'Siran' (Suran) in this area. It flows south and then west until reaching the Poonch town, after which it bends southwest, finally draining into the Mangla Reservoir near Chomukh. The towns of Poonch, Sehra, Tatta Pani, Kotli and Mirpur are situated on the banks of this river.\n\nFrederic Drew wrote of the Poonch river in 1875: \"it drains a large area of mountain country, collecting a number of streams that rise in the lofty Panjäl Range; indeed it combines all those which spring from that part of the Range north or north-west of the branching off of the Ratan ridge. It drains also a considerable area occupied by the mountains of intermediate height, and no small space of the lower, outer, hills.\"\n\nThe prominent tributaries of the river are:\n\n\n * Mandi (33.7409°N, 74.1869°W),\n * Nimbal Katha (33.756°N, 74.1432°W),\n * Darungli (33.7613°N, 74.1319°W) ,\n * Betaar (33.761°N, 74.0777°W),\n * Ranguri (33.7548°N, 74.0357°W),\n * Rangar (33.7238°N, 73.9526°W),\n * Menthar (33.6558°N, 73.9714°W),\n * Nail (33.5354°N, 73.9155°W),\n * Baan (33.5021°N, 73.8774°W),\n * Mahuli (33.4233°N, 73.8506°W), and\n * Khad (33.3492°N, 73.7621°W).\n\nThe Betaar Nala, which originates in the Azad Kashmir's Haveli District and flows southwest to join the Poonch river near the Poonch town, is sometimes called the 'Punch River'.

      "title": "Faisal Mosque",
      "description": "Faisal Mosque (undefined) is a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Islamabad, the mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by a Bedouin tent. The mosque is a major tourist attraction, and is referred as a contemporary and influential feature of Islamic architecture.\n\nConstruction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $120 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 ft tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.\n\nCombined the structure covers an area of 54,000 square ft, the mosque dominates the landscape of Islamabad. It is situated at the north end of Faisal Avenue, putting it at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla Hills, the westernmost foothills of the Himalayas. It is located on an elevated area of land against a picturesque backdrop of the national park. The largest mosque in Pakistan, the Faisal Mosque was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993, when it was overtaken by mosques in MENA region. Faisal Mosque is now the fourth largest mosque in terms of capacity.\n\nThe impetus for the mosque began in 1966 when King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz supported the initiative of the Pakistani Government to build a national mosque in Islamabad during an official visit to Pakistan.\n\nIn 1969, an international competition was held in which architects from 17 countries submitted 43 proposals. The winning design was that of Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay. Construction of the mosque began in 1976 by National Construction Limited of Pakistan, led by Azim Khan and was funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, at a cost of over 130 million Saudi riyals (approximately 120 million USD today). King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz was instrumental in the funding, and both the mosque and the road leading to it were named after him after his assassination in 1975. The mosque was completed in 1986, and used to house the International Islamic University. Many conservative Muslims criticised the design at first for its unconventional design and lack of a traditional Dome structure.\n\nThe Faisal Mosque can accommodate about 10,000 worshippers in its main prayer hall, 24,000 in its porticoes, and 40,000 in its courtyard. Each of the Mosque's four minarets are 79 m high (the tallest minarets in South Asia) and measure 10&times;10 metres in circumference.\n\n\"I tried to capture the spirit, proportion and geometry of Kaaba in a purely abstract manner. Imagine the apex of each of the four minarets as a scaled explosion of four highest corners of Kaaba – thus an unseen Kaaba form is bounded by the minarets at the four corners in a proportion of height to base. Shah Faisal Mosque akin to Kaaba.Now, if you join the apex of each minaret to the base of the minaret diagonally opposite to it correspondingly, a four-sided pyramid shall be bound by these lines at the base side within that invisible cube. That lower level pyramid is treated as a solid body while four minarets with their apex complete the imaginary cube of Kaaba.\"\n\n- Vedat Dalokay Instead of using traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay designed an eight sided main hall that looked like an Arab's Bedouin desert tent. Additionally, he added four minarets on all four corners of the main hall, which are of 80 m high, the tallest minarets in South Asia. The main structure of the building is the main prayer hall, which is supported by four concrete girders. The four unusual minarets are inspired by Turkish architecture. Vedat Dalokay also believed that the design of the Masjid represents Kaaba in an abstract manner. Entrance is from the east, where the prayer hall is fronted by a courtyard with porticoes. The International Islamic University was housed under the main courtyard, but now has relocated to a new campus. The mosque still houses a library, lecture hall, museum and cafe. The interior of the main tent-shaped hall is covered in white marble and decorated with mosaics and calligraphy by the famous Pakistani artist Sadequain, and a spectacular Turkish-style chandelier. The mosaic pattern adorns the west wall, and has the Kalimah written in early Kufic script, repeated in mirror image pattern.\n\nThe Faisal Mosque is described in the book The Kite Runner by Khalid Hosseini, and is frequently referenced in the work of Michael Muhammad Knight, who came to the mosque to study Islam as a teenager.\n\nHover your mouse over or tap the images below to see their captions.\n\n\n * Badshahi Mosque\n * Islamic art\n * List of mosques in Pakistan\n * List of largest mosques\n * List of things named after Saudi Kings\n * Timeline of Muslim history\n\n* Shah Faisal Mosque: Google 3D Warehouse",

      "title": "Centaurus",
      "description": "Centaurus is a bright constellation in the southern sky. One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius). Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Solar System, its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster as visible from Earth and the largest identified in the Milky Way, possibly a remnant of a dwarf galaxy.\n\n\n\nCentaurus contains several very bright stars. Its alpha and beta stars are used as \"pointer stars\" to help observers find the constellation Crux. Centaurus has 281 stars above magnitude 6.5, meaning that they are visible to the unaided eye, the most of any constellation. Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to the Sun, has a high proper motion; it will be a mere half-degree from Beta Centauri in approximately 4000 years.\n\nAlpha Centauri is a triple star system, a binary around which orbits Proxima Centauri, currently the nearest star to the Sun. Traditionally called Rigil Kentaurus or Toliman, meaning \"foot of the centaur\", the system has an overall magnitude of −0.28 and is 4.4 light-years from Earth. The primary and secondary are both yellow-hued stars; the first is of magnitude −0.01 and the second: 1.35. Proxima, the tertiary star, is a red dwarf of magnitude 11.0; it appears almost 2 degrees away from the close pairing of Alpha and has a period of approximately one million years. Also a flare star, Proxima has minutes-long outbursts where it brightens by over a magnitude. The Alpha couple revolve in 80-year periodicity and will next appear closest as seen from Earth's telescopes in 2037 and 2038, together as they appear to the naked eye they present the third-brightest \"star\" in the night sky.\n\nOne other first magnitude star Beta Centauri is in the constellation in a position beyond Proxima and toward the narrow axis of Crux, thus with Alpha forming a far-south limb of the constellation. Also called Hadar and Agena, it is a double star; the primary is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 0.6, 525 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 4.0 and has a modest separation, appearing only under intense magnification due to its distance.\n\nThe next bright object is Gamma Centauri, for this reason intuitively named Gamma, another binary star which appears to the naked eye at magnitude 2.2. The primary and secondary are both blue-white hued stars of magnitude 2.9; their period is 84 years.\n\nCentaurus also has many dimmer double stars and binary stars. 3 Centauri is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 4.5 and a secondary of magnitude 6.0. The primary is 344 light-years away.\n\nCentaurus is home to many variable stars. R Centauri is a Mira variable star with a minimum magnitude of 11.8 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3; it is about 1,250 light-years from Earth and has a period of 18 months. V810 Centauri is a semiregular variable.\n\nBPM 37093 is a white dwarf star whose carbon atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since diamond also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star \"Lucy\" after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\"\n\nPDS 70, (V1032 Centauri) a low mass T Tauri star is found in the constellation Centauras. In July 2018 astronomers captured the first conclusive image of a protoplanetary disc containing a nascent exoplanet, named PDS 70b.\n\nω Centauri (NGC 5139), despite being listed as the constellation's \"omega\" star, is in fact a naked-eye globular cluster, 17,000 light-years away with a diameter of 150 light-years. It is the largest and brightest globular cluster in the Milky Way; at ten times the size of the next-largest cluster, it has a magnitude of 3.7. It is also the most luminous globular cluster in the Milky Way, at over one million solar luminosities. Omega Centauri is classified as a Shapley class VIII cluster, which means that its center is loosely concentrated. It is also the only globular cluster to be designated with a Bayer letter; the globular cluster 47 Tucanae is the only one designated with a Flamsteed number. It contains several million stars, most of which are yellow dwarf stars, but also possesses red giants and blue-white stars; the stars have an average age of 12 billion years. This has prompted suspicion that Omega Centauri was the core of a dwarf galaxy that had been absorbed by the Milky Way. Omega Centauri was determined to be nonstellar in 1677 by the English astronomer Edmond Halley, though it was visible as a star to the ancients. Its status as a globular cluster was determined by James Dunlop in 1827. To the unaided eye, Omega Centauri appears fuzzy and is obviously non-circular; it is approximately half a degree in diameter, the same size as the full Moon.\n\nCentaurus is also home to open clusters. NGC 3766 is an open cluster 6,300 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye. It contains approximately 100 stars, the brightest of which are 7th magnitude. NGC 5460 is another naked-eye open cluster, 2,300 light-years from Earth, that has an overall magnitude of 6 and contains approximately 40 stars.\n\nThere is one bright planetary nebula in Centaurus, NGC 3918, also known as the Blue Planetary. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and a central star of magnitude 11.0; it is 2600 light-years from Earth. The Blue Planetary was discovered by John Herschel and named for its color's similarity to Uranus, though the nebula is apparently three times larger than the planet.\n\nCentaurus is rich in galaxies as well. NGC 4622 is a face-on spiral galaxy located 200 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0146). Its spiral arms wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a collision with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure. NGC 5253, a peculiar irregular galaxy, is located near the border with Hydra and M83, with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1–2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxy's high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus. NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as binoculars under good conditions; it has been described as \"shaped like a candle flame\", being long and thin (16' by 3'). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is NGC 5102, found by star-hopping from Iota Centauri. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis.\n\nOne of the closest active galaxies to Earth is the Centaurus A galaxy, NGC 5128, at 11 million light-years away (redshift 0.00183). It has a supermassive black hole at its core, which expels massive jets of matter that emit radio waves due to synchrotron radiation. Astronomers posit that its dust lanes, not common in elliptical galaxies, are due to a previous merger with another galaxy, probably a spiral galaxy. NGC 5128 appears in the optical spectrum as a fairly large elliptical galaxy with a prominent dust lane. Its overall magnitude is 7.0 and it has been seen under perfect conditions with the naked eye, making it one of the most distant objects visible to the unaided observer. In equatorial and southern latitudes, it is easily found by star hopping from Omega Centauri. In small telescopes, the dust lane is not visible; it begins to appear with about 4 inches of aperture under good conditions. In large amateur instruments, above about 12 inches in aperture, the dust lane's west-northwest to east-southeast direction is easily discerned. Another dim dust lane on the east side of the 12-arcminute-by-15-arcminute galaxy is also visible. ESO 270-17, also called the Fourcade-Figueroa Object, is a low-surface brightness object believed to be the remnants of a galaxy; it does not have a core and is very difficult to observe with an amateur telescope. It measures 7 arcminutes by 1 arcminute. It likely originated as a spiral galaxy and underwent a catastrophic gravitational interaction with Centaurus A around 500 million years ago, stopping its rotation and destroying its structure.\n\nNGC 4650A is a polar-ring galaxy 136 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.01). It has a central core made of older stars that resembles an elliptical galaxy, and an outer ring of young stars that orbits around the core. The plane of the outer ring is distorted, which suggests that NGC 4650A is the result of a galaxy collision about a billion years ago. This galaxy has also been cited in studies of dark matter, because the stars in the outer ring orbit too quickly for their collective mass. This suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a dark matter halo, which provides the necessary mass.\n\nOne of the closest galaxy clusters to Earth is the Centaurus Cluster at c. undefined 160 million light-years away, having redshift 0.0114. It has a cooler, denser central region of gas and a hotter, more diffuse outer region. The intracluster medium in the Centaurus Cluster has a high concentration of metals (elements heavier than helium) due to a large number of supernovae. This cluster also possesses a plume of gas whose origin is unknown.\n\nWhile Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. Precession has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern declination. In a little over 7000 years it will be at maximum visibility for those in the northern hemisphere, visible at times in the year up to quite a high northern latitude.\n\nThe figure of Centaurus can be traced back to a Babylonian constellation known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was depicted in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the rear legs and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.\n\nThe Greeks depicted the constellation as a centaur and gave it its current name. It was mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. In the 2nd century AD, Claudius Ptolemy catalogued 37 stars in Centaurus, including Alpha Centauri. Large as it is now, in earlier times it was even larger, as the constellation Lupus was treated as an asterism within Centaurus, portrayed in illustrations as an unspecified animal either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear. The Southern Cross, which is now regarded as a separate constellation, was treated by the ancients as a mere asterism formed of the stars composing the centaur's legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation Circinus was treated as undefined stars under the centaur's front hooves.\n\nAccording to the Roman poet Ovid (Fasti v.379), the constellation honors the centaur Chiron, who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including Heracles (Hercules), Theseus, and Jason, the leader of the Argonauts. It is not to be confused with the more warlike centaur represented by the zodiacal constellation Sagittarius. The legend associated with Chiron says that he was accidentally poisoned with an arrow shot by Hercules, and was subsequently placed in the heavens.\n\nIn Chinese astronomy, the stars of Centaurus are found in three areas: the Azure Dragon of the East (東方青龍, Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng), the Vermillion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, Nán Fāng Zhū Què), and the Southern Asterisms (近南極星區, Jìnnánjíxīngōu). Not all of the stars of Centaurus can be seen from China, and the unseen stars were classified among the Southern Asterisms by Xu Guangqi, based on his study of western star charts. However, most of the brightest stars of Centaurus, including α Centauri, θ Centauri (or Menkent ), ε Centauri and η Centauri, can be seen in the Chinese sky.\n\nSome Polynesian peoples considered the stars of Centaurus to be a constellation as well. On Pukapuka, Centaurus had two names: Na Mata-o-te-tokolua and Na Lua-mata-o-Wua-ma-Velo. In Tonga, the constellation was called by four names: O-nga-tangata, Tautanga-ufi, Mamangi-Halahu, and Mau-kuo-mau. Alpha and Beta Centauri were not named specifically by the people of Pukapuka or Tonga, but they were named by the people of Hawaii and the Tuamotus. In Hawaii, the name for Alpha Centauri was either Melemele or Ka Maile-hope and the name for Beta Centauri was either Polapola or Ka Maile-mua. In the Tuamotu islands, Alpha was called Na Kuhi and Beta was called Tere.\n\nTwo United States Navy ships, and, were named after Centaurus, the constellation.\n\nThe Centaurus is also a name of a Mega Mall and commercial / residential complex in Islamabad, Pakistan. Construction started in 2005 and the three 41-storey towers, the tallest structures today in Islamabad, were completed by late 2012. The shopping mall was officially opened on February 17, 2013. The Centaurus originally included a 7 star hotel, construction of which is yet to begin.\n\n\n * Centaurus (Chinese astronomy)\n * List of brightest stars\n\n;Citations\n\n*\n * References\n * Centaurus, by Chris Dolan\n * C.S.

      "description": "Islamabad Zoo (undefined), previously Marghazar Zoo, is an 82 acre zoo in Islamabad Capital Territory. It was opened in 1978, and is under the administration of Capital Development Authority of Pakistan.\n\nThe zoo started in 1978 as a refuge for leopards, spotted deer, and Indian gazelle found in the region, and is administered by Capital Development Authority of Pakistan. Located in the feet of Margalla Hills. It soon gained popularity and became a part of the Japanese garden. An aviary was later constructed. The Capital Development Authority devised a plan in August 2008 to upgrade and extend the zoo as a recreational area and wildlife sanctuary. The estimated cost of the project is 1407.8 million Pakistani rupees. As of February 2019, Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul told a Senate committee that she has requested the government to hand over the control to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board for better management of the zoo and care of the animals. Gul said, “The zoo needs to be returned from the MCI to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board that has qualified individuals and trained caretakers.”\n\nOn September 2016, the 32 year-old Asian elephant named Kavaan, turned mentally ill due to being chain bound for the last two decades. The neglect spawned international attention, and there was a #SaveKavaan hashtag on social media. The zoo consequently decided to send Kavaan to his homeland of Cambodia. In July 2017, four lion cubs died due to keepers giving them high intakes of Welmingnch milk instead of a lioness' milk. Later in 2017, a male ostrich died due to negligence of the zoo staff. In August 2018, six deer were mauled by a wolf at an extension of the zoo. The zoo has also been criticised for the insufficient or bad quality of food, the small cages they are put in, and their poor health.\n\nAves\n\nAccipitriformes Anseriformes Columbiformes * Domestic pigeon Galliformes Gruiformes * Demioselle crane Pelecaniformes * Great white pelican Psittaciformes Strigiformes * Indian eagle-owl Struthioniformes * Ostrich Mammals\n * Black kite\n * Steppe eagle\n * Lesser kestrel\n * Mute swan\n * Black swan\n * Mallard\n * Domestic goose\n * Common pheasant\n * Swinhoe's pheasant\n * Golden pheasant\n * Indian peafowl\n * Ring-necked parakeet\n * Alexandrine parakeet\n * Sulphur-crested cockatoo\n * Budgerigar\n\nArtiodactyla Carnivora Lagomorpha * Rabbit Perissodactyla * Plains zebra Primates Proboscidae * Sri Lankan elephant Reptiles\n * Chinkara\n * Blackbuck\n * Nilgai\n * Spotted deer\n * Hog deer\n * Barking deer\n * Mouflon\n * Urial\n * Brown bear\n * Lion\n * Indian wolf\n * Vervet monkey\n * Rhesus monkey\n\nTestudines\n * Indian roofed turtle\n * Red-eared slider\n * Black pond turtle\n * Indian softshell turtle\n\n\n * List of zoos in Pakistan\n * Capital Development Authority\n * Margalla hills\n * Daman-e-Koh\n * Pir Sohawa\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Heritage Museum (undefined), also known as Lok Virsa Museum is a museum administered and managed by Lok Virsa - National Institute of Folk & Traditional Heritage. It is a museum of history and culture in Islamabad, Pakistan, located on the Shakarparian Hills showcasing the living cultures of Pakistan. The museum opened in 1974 and became an autonomous institute in 2002 following the Lok Virsa Legal Status Ordinance, 2002. The museum consists of several buildings as well as an outdoor museum which can accommodate up to 3000 visitors.\n\nThe museum covers an area of 60,000 sq. ft. featuring several exhibit halls, making it the largest museum in Pakistan. Lok Virsa is commonly called the \"Museum for the people of Pakistan\", who the museum calls \"the real bearers of our cultural traditions\".\n\nThe Pakistan National Museum of Ethnology (or Folk Heritage Museum) was originally established in 1982 as the \"Folk Art Museum\". The museum showcases Pakistan's multicultural society by displaying history and living traditions of the various ethnic groups of Pakistan from all corners of the country. The museum covers an area of 20,000 square feet and in 2004 underwent renovations and was renamed. The museum is open from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm from Sunday to Thursday and Saturday. On Friday, the museum closes for one hour between 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm. The museum is closed on Mondays.\n\nIt displays the cultural heritage of Pakistani people. The living style of the different areas of Pakistan is exhibited here in statues, pictures, pottery, music and textile work. Lok Virsa is the finest cultural museum in Pakistan. It showcases art works that help in preserving the living folk and traditional culture and crafts of Pakistan. It is located near Shakarparian Hills and has a large display of embroidered costumes, jewellery, woodwork, metalwork, block printing, ivory and bone work. Traditional architecture facades exhibiting such skills as fresco, mirror work and marble inlay; tile, mosaic and stucco tracery are also displayed. Adjacent to the Lok Virsa Museum, the Lok Virsa Heritage Reference Library is well equipped with resource data on ethnography, anthropology, folk music, art, history and crafts. Books on culture, heritage, audio and video-cassettes of folk and classical vocal and instrumental music are available for sale at Lok Virsa’s sales centre.\n\nThis museum is highly recommended to school teachers to arrange and plan their field trips so that their students can learn to appreciate art, culture and their heritage. A great place to visit for families and their out-of-town visiting guests.\n\nIn 2013, a Sufis and Shrines Hall was established within the Pakistan National Museum of Ethnology, popularly known as the Heritage Museum.\n\nIn this hall, there are pictures of musicians standing in performing postures singing poetry of sufi saints like Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and Sachal Sarmast. Also on display are pictures of shrines of Data Ganj Bakhsh, Shah Rukne Alam and Bahauddin Zakariya.\n\nLok Virsa has also published a series of books on sufi saints like Bulleh Shah, Sultan Bahu, Waris Shah and Mian Muhammad Bakhsh.\n\nThe Pakistan Monument Museum was established in 2010 to pay tribute to all those who worked and sacrificed everything for the Independence of Pakistan. The Museum depicts ancient civilizations, the freedom struggle of Pakistan, the birth of Pakistan and major achievements of the country. It also facilities a reference library, audio-visual archive, conference hall along with a sixty-two seat capacity auditorium known as Panorama Hall.\n\nThe Lok Virsa Library (or Heritage Library) consists of over 32,000 books, journals, manuscripts and field reports pertaining to Pakistani folklore, ethnology, cultural anthropology, art history and craft as well as over 200 books published by Lok Virsa.

The library provides valuable intangible benefits as a source of national, regional, and local identity. Numerous manuscripts, original research reports, field surveys and monographs on Pakistani culture are accessible to the public.\n\nThe Virsa Research & Publication Centre conducts field surveys particularly in the rural regions to record oral traditions. Lok Virsa has the mandate to document traditional heritage at the regional, district and sub-district level. Since the institute has currently no branches in other regions, a network of writers, scholars, universities, colleges and schools has been involved to carry out the task at the regional level. Towards this end, Lok Virsa commissions research projects and papers on significant aspects of our culture to students from different universities and colleges and also funds independent research studies. It conducts and commissions research in all sub-fields of folk and traditional heritage such as folk songs, folktales, games and celebrations. It publishes books on various facets of Pakistani folklore and cultural heritage covering all provinces and regions of Pakistan. The findings are later compiled in reports and then published in books, which are later sold by Lok Virsa and freely available at the Lok Virsa Library. Many of these are national award-winning books and a number of these are prescribed at the postgraduate level.\n\nThe Virsa Media Centre undertakes recordings to focus on traditional music and cultural heritage. It has helped edit, compile and produce a set of fifty one cultural documentaries and three thousand hours of audio recordings. A professional state-of-the-art studio is operational and so are the mobile units which are well-equipped to capture/record event in any part of the country. Lok Virsa is one of the largest publishers of the traditional music and culture. Audio and video cassettes, CDs, VCDs and DVDs produced by Lok Virsa are available in the market. Lok Virsa has edited, complied and produced a set of 36 cultural documentaries and over 500 audio cassette labels of nation’s cultural heritage.

      "description": "\n\nThe Margalla Hills (مارگلہ پہاڑیاں) is a hill range which is part of the Himalayan foothills located within the Margalla Hills National Park, north of Islamabad, Pakistan. The Margalla range has an area of 12,605 hectares. The hills are a part of Murree hills. It is a range with many valleys as well as high mountains.\n\nOn 6 January 2012, after almost six years, Pir Sohawa, the city's highest tourist spot, received few inches of snowfall. Another measurable snow event occurred on 11 February 2016 where 2 inches fell after four years.\n\nKhayaban-e- Iqbal, arises on the north east side from the 4th Avenue (Nur Pur Shahan), runs between E and F sectors and ends at Service road West of F 11 and E 11 (Golra) sectors in the south east. It will be extended up to Grand Trunk (GT) road in the near future and then it will be able to connect Nur Pur Shahan with the GT road.\n\nAccording to the research carried out by scientists and archaeologists of the project \"Post-Earthquake Explorations of Human Remains in Margalla Hills\", the formation of the Margalla Hills dates to the Miocene epoch. The dominant limestone of the Margalla is mixed with sandstone and occasional minor beds of shale. The archaeologists of the project have also found two human footprints over one million years old here, preserved in sandstone.\n\n\n\nThere are around 250 to 300 species of plants on the Margalla hills. As many as two third of them are used by the people for their medicinal effects to treat or cure various diseases.\n\nThe Margalla Hills are home to various species of wildlife, including monkeys, exotic birds and carnivores such as the rare and presently endangered Margalla leopard.\n\nMuch less common are leopards, which occasionally come down from the Murree area but usually remain high up in the hills. Villagers dwelling in the Margallas do report sighting of leopards off and on.\n\nHigh diversity of birds in the Margallas is due to the combination many ecological components that together make it a unique location. No other Pakistani location could come even near in the number of species seen. As a result of a series of faunal survey of the park, 54 species of butterflies, 37 species of fish, 9 species of amphibians, 20 species of reptiles, 380 species of birds, 21 species of small mammals and 15 species of large mammals have so far been recorded.\n\n\n\nThe Margallas are an excellent place for bird watchers. The area is home to a large number of birds, including robins, sparrows, kites, crows, larks, paradise flycatchers, black partridge, shrikes, pheasants, spotted doves, Egyptian vultures, falcons, hawks, eagles, Himalayan griffon vulture, laggar falcon, peregrine falcon, kestrel, Indian sparrow hawk, white cheeked bulbul, yellow vented bulbul, paradise flycatcher, cheer pheasant, Khalij pheasant, golden oriole, spotted dove, collared dove, wheatears and buntings.\n\nThe cheer pheasant, indigenous to the North West Frontier Province, is being reared in Margalla Hills as a part of conservation campaign.\n\nThe ecology of Margallas faces threats from quarrying by 'crush plants', deforestation, illegal encroachments and buildings, and poachers. Crush plants situated around the hills near Taxila are busy eroding the hills for extracting building material. Deforestation is resulting from fires and illegal felling of trees.\n\nMargalla Hills Society established in 1989, with objective to preserve the natural environment of Margalla Hills National Park and prevent shrinkage of the green areas; to promote public interest in conservation, development and management of forests, wildlife and other natural resources of Margalla Hills National Park, and to disseminate information about the park, including its history, geography, flora, fauna, culture, and its benefits to the citizens of Islamabad.\n\nThe WWF-Pakistan's 'Green School Programme', in collaboration with the Capital Development Authority (CDA), carries out 'Eco-Adventure Activities' on the Margalla hills to raise awareness in the school children regarding the conservation of natural environment and about the importance of being environmentally responsible.\n\n\n * On 28 July 2010, Airblue Flight 202 crashed in the Margalla Hills.\n * On 6 January 2012, snowfall over Margalla Hills.\n * On 11 February 2016, snowfall over Margalla Hills.\n\n\n * Margalla Hills National Park\n * Birds of Islamabad\n * Airblue Flight 202\n * Faisal Mosque\n\n*Shadara Islamabad https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahdara,_Islamabad\n\n",

      "title": "Murree",
      "description": "Murree (Punjabi, undefined, marī, meaning \"apex\") is a mountain resort town, located in the Galyat region of the Pir Panjal Range, within the Rawalpindi District of Punjab, Pakistan. It forms the outskirts of the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area, and is about 30 km northeast of Islamabad. It has average altitude of 2291 m.\n\nConstruction of the town was started in 1851 on the hill of Murree as a sanatorium for British troops. The permanent town of Murree was constructed in 1853 and the church was consecrated shortly thereafter. One main road was established, commonly referred to even in modern times, as the mall. Murree was the summer headquarters of the colonial Punjab Government until 1876 when it was moved to Shimla.\n\nMurree became a popular tourist station for British within the British India, several prominent Englishmen were born here including Bruce Bairnsfather, Francis Younghusband and Reginald Dyer. During colonial era access to commercial establishments was restricted for non-Europeans including the Lawrence College. In 1901, the population of the town was officially 1,844, although if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.\n\nSince the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, Murree has retained its position as a popular hill station, noted for its pleasant summers. A large number of tourists visit the town from the Islamabad-Rawalpindi area. The town also serves as a transit point for tourist's visiting Azad Kashmir and Abbottabad. The town is noted for its Tudorbethan and neo-gothic architecture. The Government of Pakistan owns a summer retreat in Murree, where foreign dignitaries including heads of state often visit.\n\nThe town is considered by some of its locals and by adherents of the Ahmadiyya movement to be the final resting place of Mary, mother of Jesus.\n\nMurree or Marhee as it was then called, was first identified as a potential hill station by Major James Abbott (Indian Army officer) in 1847.\n\nThe town's early development was in 1851 by President of the Punjab Administrative Board, Sir Henry Lawrence. It was originally established as a sanatorium for British troops garrisoned on the Afghan frontier. Officially, the municipality was created in 1850.\n\nThe permanent town of Murree was constructed at Sunnybank in 1853. The church was sanctified in May 1857, and the main road, Jinnah Road, originally known as Mall Road and still commonly referred to as \"The Mall\"), was built. The most significant commercial establishments, the Post Office, general merchants with European goods, tailors and a millinery, were established opposite the church. Until 1947, access to Mall Road was restricted for \"natives\" (non-Europeans).\n\nIn the summer of 1857, a rebellion against the British broke out. The local tribes of Murree and Hazara, including the Dhund Abbasis and others, attacked the depleted British Army garrison in Murree; however, the tribes were ultimately overcome by the British and capitulated. From 1873 to 1875, Murree was the summer headquarters of the Punjab local government; after 1876 the headquarters were moved to Shimla.\n\nThe railway connection with Lahore, the capital of the Punjab Province, via Rawalpindi, made Murree a popular resort for Punjab officials, and the villas and other houses erected for the accommodation of English families gave it a European aspect. The houses crowned the summit and sides of an irregular ridge, the neighbouring hills were covered during the summer with encampments of British troops, while the station itself was filled with European visitors from the plains and travellers to Kashmir. It was connected with Rawalpindi by a service tangas.\n\nIt was described in the Gazetteer of Rawalpindi District, 1893–94 as follows:\n\nThe sanatorium of Murree lies in north latitude 33° 54′ 30″ and east longitude 73° 26′ 30″, at an elevation of 7517 ft above sea level, and contained a standing population of 1,768 inhabitants, which was, however, enormously increased during the [May–November] season by the influx of visitors and their attendant servants and shopkeepers. It is the most accessible hill station in the Punjab, being distant from Rawalpindi only a five hours' journey by tonga dak. Magnificent views are to be obtained in the spring and autumn of the snow crowned mountains of Kashmir; and gorgeous sunset and cloud effects seen daily during the rains [July–August]. Part of the station, especially the Kashmir end, are also well wooded and pretty.\n\nIn 1901 the permanent population of the town was 1,844; if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.\n\nMurree features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. It is situated in the outer Himalayas, retaining high altitude. This type of area has cold, snowy winters, relatively cool summers with drastically escalated rain, in relation with lower altitudes, and frequent fog. Precipitation is received year round, with two maxima, first one during winter and second one at summer, July–August. Total mean precipitation annually is 1789 mm.Murree receives around 62.6 inches of snow per year according to a 13-year data.\n\nA variety of rare animal species can be found in Murree, including the leopard, which inhabits the neighboring Galiyat region. Common animals include the rhesus monkey, wild boar, foxes and various species of birds, including the cheer pheasant and kalij pheasant. Murree gives its name to the Murree vole, a rodent species endemic to Pakistan. Murree's climate is unpredictable. It can change any time.\n\n\n * Sadaqat Ali Abbasi,Politician & Sitting MNA\n * Shahid Khakan Abbasi, former Prime Minister of Pakistan\n * Ansar Abbasi, journalist and socially conservative commentator\n * Muztar Abbasi, scholar\n * Zafar Mahmood Abbasi, Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) of Pakistan Navy\n * Mehtab Abbasi, politician\n * khaqan Abbasi, politician\n * Marriyum Aurangzeb, politician\n * Kashif Abbasi, journalist, television talk show host and anchorperson\n * Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, politician\n * Sadia Abbasi, politician\n * Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi, former justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a former justice of Lahore High Court\n * Reginald Dyer, British Army Officer\n * Mohammad Wasim, Cricketer\n * Muhammad Riaz Khan, Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)\n\n\n\n*\n\n",

      "description": "The Pakistan Monument (undefined) is a national monument and heritage museum located on the western Shakarparian Hills in Islamabad, Pakistan. The monument was constructed to symbolize the unity of the Pakistani people. It is dedicated to the People of Pakistan who sacrificed their TODAY for a better TOMORROW. Its elevation makes the monument visible from across the Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area and is a popular tourist destination.\n\nCovering a total area of 2.8 hectares, the Design of the monument is rooted in the rich Moghul Architecture of the Subcontinent. Its petal shaped structure is derived from the traditional MUQARNAS of Moghul Architecture. As the Architect says: \"We should learn from History but not remain in it.\" He used today's technology to modernize the Historical form of the Muqarnas. The resultant petal-shaped structure emphasizes the importance of Unity & togetherness of the People of Pakistan. Rather than symbolizing the four provinces (as is mistakenly observed) It represents the four different CULTURES of the people of Pakistan. Four Large petals represent each of the four cultures, The Punjabi, The Balochi, The Sindhi & The Pakhtun. The three smaller petals represent: Minorities, Azad Kashmir & The tribal areas. All seven petals, though independent of each other, stand together in Unison to form the Nation of Pakistan. Standing together, they are protecting the STAR & THE CRESCENT of the Flag of Pakistan.The star of the Flag in the Monument is designed in Shiny Black Granite with Golden Stars which represent the people who sacrificed their life for Pakistan. The moon Crescent is made form Stainless steel with Inspirational writings of the Quaid e Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal. The petals are built of granite, (projecting in a suspended cantilever form, among the largest in Asia) and its inner walls are covered with ART WORK depicting the various Landmarks of the Nation. Such as: Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque, Khyber Pass and Minar-e-Pakistan. Other than the Peoples Monument, there is a Museum which Narrates the History and tells the story of the creation of Pakistan. These two structures are connected by a large Piazza, known as the freedom Plaza. Though the name of the Architect: Arif Masoud in inscribed in stone in the main Dedication Plaque, located at the beginning of the main plaza, He has honored all the construction workers by placing their HAND IMPRESSIONS all along the long walls flanking this freedom Plaza on both the sides. At the farthest end is a viewing platform which gives a bird's-eye view of Islamabad City. web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/pakistan/islamabad-and-rawalpindi/sights/landmarks-monuments/pakistan-monument|title=Pakistan Monument - Lonely Planet|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=Lonely Planet|access-date=2016-06-13}}\n\nAdjoining the monument is the Pakistan Monument Museum, which includes a wax museum depicting important events leading to the Pakistan Movement. Furthermore, the facilities includes a reference library, audio-visual archive, conference hall along with a 62-seat capacity auditorium known as Panorama Hall. The complex receives on average received 1500 tourists per day totalling at 0.57 million visitors in 2015. From air the monument looks like a star (center) and a crescent moon (formed by walls forming the petals), these represent the star and crescent on Pakistan's flag. The foundation stone was laid on 25 May 2004, completed in 2006 and inaugurated on 23 March 2007 by President General Pervez Musharaf.\n\nThe plan for a National Monument was first envisioned in 2005 by then President Parvez Musharraf and assisted by Uxi Mufti, son of Mumtaz Mufti. The idea was later adopted by Ministry of Culture led by Hamad Kashif and in 2005. To make the process transparent, President Musharraf tasked Pakistan Council of Architects & Town Planners to organise a national monument design competition based around the theme of signifying strength, unity and dedication of the people of Pakistan into an icon representing an independent and free nation. From a total of 21 submissions, 3 were short-listed. The final design proposed by Arif Masoud was selected.\n\n\n\n\n * Minar-e-Pakistan\n * History of Pakistan\n\n",

      "title": "National Museum of Natural History",
      "description": "The National Museum of Natural History is a natural history museum administered by the Smithsonian Institution, located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., United States. It has free admission and is open 364 days a year. In 2016, with 7.1 million visitors, it was the fourth most visited museum in the world and the most visited natural history museum in the world. Opened in 1910, the museum on the National Mall was one of the first Smithsonian buildings constructed exclusively to hold the national collections and research facilities. The main building has an overall area of 1,500,000 ft2 with 325,000 ft2 of exhibition and public space and houses over 1,000 employees.\n\nThe museum's collections contain over 126 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts. It is also home to about 185 professional natural history scientists&mdash;the largest group of scientists dedicated to the study of natural and cultural history in the world.\n\n\n\nThe United States National Museum was founded in 1846 as part of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum was initially housed in the Smithsonian Institution Building, which is better known today as the Smithsonian Castle. A formal exhibit hall opened in 1858. The growing collection led to the construction of a new building, the National Museum Building (known today as the Arts and Industries Building). Covering a then-enormous 2.25 acre, it was built in just 15 months at a cost of $310,000. It opened in March 1881.\n\nCongress authorized construction of a new building on June 28, 1902. On January 29, 1903, a special committee composed of members of Congress and representatives from the Smithsonian's board of regents published a report asking Congress to fund a much larger structure than originally planned. The regents began considering sites for the new building in March, and by April 12 settled on a site on the north side of B Street NW between 9th and 12th Streets. The D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower & Marshall was chosen to design the structure. Testing of the soil for the foundations was set for July 1903, with construction expected to take three years.\n\nThe Natural History Building (as the National Museum of Natural History was originally known) opened its doors to the public on March 17, 1910, in order to provide the Smithsonian Institution with more space for collections and research. The building was not fully completed until June 1911. The structure cost $3.5 million (about $85 million in inflation-adjusted 2012) dollars. The Neoclassical style building was the first structure constructed on the north side of the National Mall as part of the 1901 McMillan Commission plan. In addition to the Smithsonian's natural history collection, it also housed the American history, art, and cultural collections.\n\nBetween 1981 and 2003, the National Museum of Natural History had 11 permanent and acting directors. There were six directors alone between 1990 and 2002. Turnover was high as the museum's directors were disenchanted by low levels of funding and the Smithsonian's inability to clearly define the museum's mission. Robert W. Fri was named the museum's director in 1996. One of the largest donations in Smithsonian history was made during Fri's tenure. Kenneth E. Behring donated $20 million in 1997 to modernize the museum. Fri resigned in 2001 after disagreeing with Smithsonian leadership over the reorganization of the museum's scientific research programs.\n\nJ. Dennis O'Connor, Provost of the Smithsonian Institution (where he oversaw all science and research programs) was named acting director of the museum on July 25, 2001. Eight months later, O'Conner resigned to become the vice president of research and dean of the graduate school at the University of Maryland. Douglas Erwin, a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History, was appointed interim director in June 2002.\n\n\n\nIn January 2003, the Smithsonian announced that Cristián Samper, a Colombian with an M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, would become the museum's permanent director on March 31, 2003. Samper (who holds dual citizenship with Colombia and the United States) founded the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute and ran the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute after 2001. Smithsonian officials said Samper's administrative experience proved critical in his appointment. Under Samper's direction, the museum opened the $100 million Behring Hall of Mammals in November 2003, received $60 million in 2004 for the Sant Hall of Oceans, and received a $1 million gift from Tiffany & Co. for the purchase of precious gems for the National Gem Collection.\n\nOn March 25, 2007, Lawrence M. Small, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the organization's highest-ranking appointed official, resigned abruptly after public reports of lavish spending.\n\nOn March 27, 2007 Samper was appointed Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian. Paul G. Risser, former chancellor of the University of Oklahoma, was named Acting Director of the Museum of Natural History on March 29.\n\nSamper's tenure at the museum was not without controversy. In May 2007, Robert Sullivan, the former associate director in charge of exhibitions at the National Museum of Natural History, charged that Samper and Smithsonian Undersecretary for Science David Evans (Samper's supervisor) ordered \"last minute\" changes in the exhibit \"Arctic: A Friend Acting Strangely\" to tone down the role of human beings in the discussion of global warming, and to make global warming seem more uncertain than originally depicted. Samper denied that he knew of any scientific objections to the changes, and said that no political pressure had been applied to the Smithsonian to make the changes. In November 2007, The Washington Post reported that an interagency group of scientists from the Department of the Interior, NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Science Foundation believed that, despite Samper's denial, the museum \"acted to avoid criticism from congressional appropriators and global-warming skeptics in the Bush administration\". The changes were discussed as early as mid-August 2005, and Dr. Waleed Abdalati, manager of NASA's Cryospheric Sciences Program, noted at the time that \"There was some discussion of the political sensitivities of the exhibit.\" Although the exhibit was due to open in October 2005, the Post reported that Samper ordered a six-month delay to allow for even further changes. The newspaper also reported that it had obtained a memo drafted by Samper shortly after October 15, 2005, in which Samper said the museum should not \"replicate\" work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A few weeks later, a NOAA climate researcher advised a superior that the delay was due to \"the debate within the administration and the science community over the existence and cause of global warming\". During the delay, Samper asked high-level officials in other government agencies and departments to review the script for the exhibit, ordered his museum staff to make additionals changes, and rearranged the sequence of the exhibit panels so that the discussion of climate change was not immediately encountered by museum visitors. Shortly before the exhibit opened in April 2006, officials at NOAA and the United States Department of Commerce expressed to their superiors their opinion that the exhibit had been changed to accommodate political concerns. In an interview with The Washington Post in November 2007, Samper said he felt the exhibit displayed a scientific certainty that did not exist, and expressed his belief that the museum should present evidence on both sides and let the public make up its own mind.\n\n\n\nThe controversy became more heated after the press reported that Samper gave permission for the museum to accept a $5 million donation from American Petroleum Institute that would support the museum's soon-to-be-opened Hall of Oceans. Two members of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents (which had final say on accepting the donation) questioned whether the donation was a conflict of interest. Before the board could consider the donation, the donor withdrew the offer. Risser resigned as acting director of the museum on January 22, 2008, in order to return to his position at the University of Oklahoma. No new acting director was named at that time. Six weeks later, the Smithsonian regents chose Georgia Tech president G. Wayne Clough as the new Secretary. Samper stepped down to return to his position as Director of the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe remainder of Samper's tenure at the museum proved less controversial. In June 2008, the Victoria and Roger Sant family donated $15 million to endow the new Ocean Hall at the museum. The museum celebrated the 50th anniversary of its acquisition of the Hope Diamond in August 2009 by giving the gemstone its own exhibit and a new setting. In March 2010, the museum opened its $21 million human evolution hall.\n\nIn January 2012, Samper said he was stepping down from the National Museum of Natural History to become president and chief executive officer of the Wildlife Conservation Society. Two months later, the museum announced it had received a $35 million gift to renovate its dinosaur hall, and a month later the Sant family donated another $10 million to endow the director's position. On July 25, 2012 Kirk Johnson, vice president of research and collections at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, was named Samper's successor effective October 29, 2012. Johnson oversees a museum with 460 employees and a $68 million budget.\n\nThe Smithsonian gives an approximate number for artifacts and specimens of 127.3 million. More specifically, the collections include 30 million insects, 4.5 million plants preserved in the Museum's herbarium, and 7 million fish stored in liquid-filled jars. Of the 2 million cultural artifacts, 400,000 are photographs housed in the National Anthropological Archives. Through an off-site active loan and exchange program, the museum's collections can be accessed. As a result, 3.5 million specimens are out on loan every year. The rest of the collections not on display are stored in the non-public research areas of the museum and at the Museum Support Center, located in Suitland, MD. Other facilities include a marine science center in Ft. Pierce, Florida and field stations in Belize, Alaska, and Kenya.\n\nResearch in the museum is divided into seven departments: anthropology, botany, entomology, invertebrate zoology, mineral sciences, paleobiology, vertebrate zoology.\n\nOne collection of nearly a million specimens of birds, reptiles, and mammals kept at the museum has been maintained by the Biological Survey unit of the U.S. Geological Survey. This division had started in 1885 as an economic ornithology unit of the Agriculture Department. Clarence Birdseye and Clinton Hart Merriam had worked in this organization. As of February 2018, the unit's funding is planned to be cut, and it is not clear what would happen to the collection.\n\n\n\nThe National Gem and Mineral Collection is one of the most significant collections of its kind in the world. The collection includes some of the most famous pieces of gems and minerals including the Hope Diamond and the Star of Asia Sapphire, one of the largest sapphires in the world. There are currently over 15,000 individual gems in the collection, as well as 350,000 minerals and 300,000 samples of rock and ore specimens. Additionally, the Smithsonian's National Gem and Mineral Collection houses approximately 35,000 meteorites, which is considered to be one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world.\n\nThe collection is displayed in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, one of the many galleries in the Museum of Natural History. Some of the most important donors, besides Hooker, are Washington A. Roebling, the man who built the Brooklyn Bridge, who gave 16,000 specimens to the collection; Frederick A. Canfield, who donated 9,000 specimens to the collection; and Dr. Isaac Lea, who donated the basis of the museum's collection of 1312 gems and minerals.\n\nThe David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins opened on March 17, 2010, marking the museum's 100th anniversary. The hall is named for David H. Koch, who contributed $15 million to the $20.7 million exhibit.\n\nThe Hall is \"dedicated to the discovery and understanding of human origins,\" and occupies 15000 sqft of exhibit space. Specimens include 75 replica skulls, an interactive human family tree that follows six million years of evolution, and a Changing the World gallery that focuses on issues surrounding climate change and humans' impact on the world. The Hall's core concept idea is \"What Does It Mean To Be Human\", and focuses on milestones of Human Evolution such as Walking Upright, Bigger Brains, and Creating a World of Symbols. Also covered is the Smithsonian's significant research on the geological and climate changes which occurred in East Africa during significant periods of Human Evolution. The exhibit highlights an actual fossil Neanderthal and replicas created by famed paleoartist, John Gurche. The exhibit has been criticized for downplaying the significance of human-caused global warming.\n\nThe exhibit also provides a complementary web site, which provides diaries and podcasts directly from related fields of research. The Companion Book, What Does It Mean To Be Human was written by Richard (Rick) Potts, the Curator, and Christopher Sloan. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.\n\nThe museum has over 570,000 catalogued reptiles from around the world. The National Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles has increased 300 percent since 1970 to over 570,000 specimen records in 2008. The Hall of Dinosaurs has fossilized skeletons and cast models, including Tyrannosaurus rex cast facing a Triceratops cast. The Triceratops exhibit shows the first accurate dinosaur skeleton in virtual motion, achieved through the use of scanning and digital technology.\" The collection consists of 46 \"complete and important specimens\" of dinosaurs.\n\nIn May 2012, billionaire David H. Koch donated $35 million toward the cost of a $45 million upgrade to the 30-year-old, 25000 sqft dinosaur hall. The hall is anticipated to close in the spring of 2014 and reopen in 2019.\n\nIn June 2013, the Smithsonian obtained a 50-year lease on a T. rex fossil skeleton owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It is the first T. rex skeleton to be displayed at the museum, which until now has only had the cast of a skull. The specimen, known as the \"Wankel\" or \"Devil\" rex, was found on Corps-owned land in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in Montana in 1988. It has since been on display at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana (which helped excavate the fossil). The \"Wankel rex\" (whose skeleton is 85 percent complete) was to be unveiled at the Museum of Natural History on National Fossil Day, October 16, 2013, and was supposed to be on display until the dinosaur hall exhibit closes for renovation in the spring of 2014. The 35 ft long skeleton will be the centerpiece of the dinosaur hall when it re-opens in 2019. The Museum of the Rockies (which did not own the skeleton but was the repository for it) has about a dozen T. rex specimens, including one which is eighty percent complete. Only about six museums in the United States have a T. rex skeleton. The Museum of the Rockies is a Smithsonian affiliate museum, and had long promised to find a T. rex for the Smithsonian to display.\n\nDue to the 2013 federal government shutdown, the fossil did not arrive in Washington, D.C. Smithsonian officials said it remained in storage in Montana, and would not arrive at the Smithsonian until late spring 2014. Packed up in 16 crates, the T. rex, named \"Nation's T. rex\" by the Smithsonian, traveled from the Museum of the Rockies and arrived at the National Museum of Natural History on April 15, 2014. The T. rex has been displayed in the Rex Room, while specialists performed a conservation assessment and the Smithsonian Digitization Program scanned each bone, to create a 3-D model for research. The Nation's T. rex will be the centerpiece of the new fossil hall, opening in 2019.\n\nThe Behring Hall of Mammals was designed by Reich + Petch. The mammal specimens are presented as works of modern art within minimal environmentals. Visitors discover mammal's evolutionary adaptions to hugely diverse contexts, and ultimately discover that they too are mammals.\n\nThe museum has the largest collection of vertebrate specimens in the world, nearly twice the size of the next largest mammal collections, including historically important collections from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Its collection was initiated by C. Hart Merriam and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (later the Department of the Interior), which expanded it in the 1890s-1930s.\n\nThe O. Orkin Insect Zoo features live insects and exhibits about insects and entomologists. Different habitats have been created to show the type of insects that live in different environments and how they have adapted to a freshwater pond, house, mangrove swamp, desert, and rain forest. The zoo is sponsored by Orkin, a pest control company.\n\nThe Sant Ocean Hall opened on September 27, 2008, and is the largest renovation of the museum since it opened in 1910. The hall includes 674 marine specimens and models drawn from the over 80 million specimens in the museum's total collection, the largest in the world. The hall is named for the Roger Sant family, who donated $15 million to endow the new hall and other related programs.\n\nThe collection includes: a coelenterate-long North Atlantic Right Whale, a 1500 USgal aquarium, one female giant squid displayed in the center of the hall and a male displayed off to the side, an adult coelenterate, and a Basilosaurus.\n\nThe museum also provides the Smithsonian Ocean Portal, a complementary web site which provides regularly updated, original content from the museum's research, collections, and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by more than 20 collaborating organizations, including Archive, Census of Marine Life, Consortium for Ocean Leadership, Encyclopedia of Life, INDUCT, Monterrey Bay Aquarium, Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, National Geographic, NOAA, New England Aquarium, Ocean Conservancy, Oceania, Pew Charitable Trusts, Sea Web, Save Our Seas, Scrips Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, World Heritage Marine Programmer.\n\nThis exhibit and associated website \"examines the diversity, dynamism, and global influence of Africa's peoples and cultures over time in the realms of family, work, community, and the natural environment.\"\n\nFeaturing a live butterfly pavilion allows \"visitors to observe the many ways in which butterflies and other animals have evolved, adapted, and diversified together with their plant partners over tens of millions of years.\" The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.\n\n\"This hall explores some examples from various cultures in the western world including northern Iraq, ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome and the recent discovery of the Iceman, a Copper Age mummy found in an Italian glacier.\" This exhibit closed September 26, 2010.\n\nThe Korea Gallery is a special showcase to celebrate Korean traditions and examine its unique influence and complex role in the world today.\n\nThe exhibit expresses the continuity of the past by highlighting enduring features of Korean culture that have influence and resonance today. The exhibit uses the Smithsonian ceramics collection as well as a rich selection of photographs, ritual objects and traditional Korean carpentry to communicate and connect to both the local Korean community and an international audience. Traditional art forms, such as ceramics and calligraphy, along with mythological figures, language, large feature photographs and illustrations speak to a range of shared historical memories that connect Koreans at home and abroad.\n\nPersonal stories of modern Koreans, as told in their own voices, provide a context to discuss some of the many issues that face the divided country today. Korea's incredible transformation from 'The Hermit Kingdom' to a world power is traced through its impact on the arts, the economy and popular culture. The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch.\n\nThis exhibit displays a \"variety of vertebrate skeletons grouped by their evolutionary relationships.\"\n\nOpened since 2013, this exhibit is the museum's interactive and educational area. Using, microscopes and touch screens, the area hosts various interactive activities and puzzles visitors can experience and contains a \"collection zone\" that houses over 6000 different specimens and artifacts visitors are able personally handle. The area also hosts various events such as allowing visitors to meet and discuss with Smithsonian scientists and hosting school groups.\n\nThe Discovery Room, a family- and student-friendly hands-on activity room on the first floor.\n\nIn the lower level, there is a bird exhibit, Urban Bird Habitat Garden, with all the migratory and native birds to Washington D.C.\n\nThe Global Volcanism Program is housed in the department of Mineral Sciences.\n\nThe museum frequently hosts sleepovers through the Smithsonian Associates for children ages 8–12.\n\n\n\n\n * In Fallout 3, a derelict exhibit at the museum serves as the entrance to Underworld, a civilization established by ghouls.\n * In the 2008 film Get Smart, the fictional spy organization CONTROL is located underneath the National Museum of Natural History.\n * The giant squid from the National Museum of Natural History inspired the octopus that comes to life in 20th Century Fox's film Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.\n * The exteriors of the Museum were used as a model for the \"Leyendecker Museum\" in the Sierra On-Line 1991 adventure game The Dagger of Amon Ra.\n * A version of the museum is featured as a partially-explorable location and one of the few quarantined areas in the 2019 third-person shooter The Division 2.\n\n\n * D'Angelis, Gina.

      "description": "Fatima Jinnah Park (undefined, Bagh-e-Fatima Jinnah), is a public recreational park situated within the Sector F-9 of Islamabad, Pakistan. It is named after Fatima Jinnah, the younger sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. It was designed by Michael Japero, and it was inaugurated in 1992.\n\nFatima Jinnah Park vast acreage is mostly covered by greenery, with a few man-made structures dotting the landscape. Most of the park area is effectively a wildlife sanctuary, except for a few areas of the park that are close to residential districts. The park is bounded by a steel fence with entrance doors placed at regular intervals, although only a few are routinely open and used. A further strip of land outside of the fence is lined with a footpath. A well laid network of footpaths lies inside the park, with neat grass and a few statues. The park is known for its wildlife, and the question of further development there divides people in the surrounding communities, many of whom worry that development would jeopardize its untamed feel.\n\nThe park's open spaces are commonly used for recreational walking and outdoor sports. Occasionally, they are used for driving lessons. Because of a lack of attendance, the roads in the park are not managed so as to provide smooth driving, but they are still useful in teaching young drivers how to negotiate a few tight turns.\n\nOnly a few areas of Fatima Jinnah Park are well developed, containing busy clusters of buildings, while other areas rarely see human activity. One of the more developed areas is the Megazone complex, which includes a sports zone with a standard-length swimming pool and tables for table tennis and snooker. The complex also includes facilities for bowling, arcade games, laser tag, and other games; areas for a fast food and dining; and an assortment of shops for clothes, DVDs, and other items.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered a McDonald's fast-food restaurant and several clubs, such as an Aeromodelling Club, that had been operating inside F-9 Park to close down. Yet, as of March 2011, the McDonald's had reopened.\n\nPakistan’s largest public park goes solar with 3,400 solar panels installed on an area of around five acres inside the 750-acre Park at a cost of $4.8 million. These panels would generate about 0.85 megawatts (850KW) of power and have a back-up facility to provide energy to street lights. Funds for the project were provided by the Chinese government as a grant.\n\nThe Capital Development Authority (CDA), which manages the park, has grand plans for the space, which is sometimes called the \"sleeping heart\" of Islamabad. The issue of the park's development is more pressing now that the people of Islamabad have taken a keen interest in recreational activities. The CDA's proposed future design for the park will include lakes, rock gardens, aquariums, and fountains.\n\n\n\n\n * List of parks and gardens in Pakistan\n * List of parks and gardens in Lahore\n * List of parks and gardens in Karachi\n\n\n\n",

It is a museum of history and culture in Islamabad, Pakistan, located on the Shakarparian Hills showcasing the living cultures of Pakistan. The museum opened in 1974 and became an autonomous institute in 2002 following the Lok Virsa Legal Status Ordinance, 2002. The museum consists of several buildings as well as an outdoor museum which can accommodate up to 3000 visitors.\n\nThe museum covers an area of 60,000 sq. ft. featuring several exhibit halls, making it the largest museum in Pakistan. Lok Virsa is commonly called the \"Museum for the people of Pakistan\", who the museum calls \"the real bearers of our cultural traditions\".\n\nThe Pakistan National Museum of Ethnology (or Folk Heritage Museum) was originally established in 1982 as the \"Folk Art Museum\".

Lok Virsa has the mandate to document traditional heritage at the regional, district and sub-district level. Since the institute has currently no branches in other regions, a network of writers, scholars, universities, colleges and schools has been involved to carry out the task at the regional level. Towards this end, Lok Virsa commissions research projects and papers on significant aspects of our culture to students from different universities and colleges and also funds independent research studies. It conducts and commissions research in all sub-fields of folk and traditional heritage such as folk songs, folktales, games and celebrations.

      "description": " Hazrat Sayyid Shah ʿAbd al-Laṭīf Kazmi Qadri, often referred to as Barī Imām or Barī Sarkār, or reverentially as Syed Shah ʿAbd al-Laṭīf was a 17th-century Sufi ascetic from Punjab who was the most prominent Sufi of the Qadiriyya order and venerated as the patron saint of Islamabad, Pakistan.Born in Karsal in 1617 to a family descended from Holy Prohet Muhammad through the linage of Imam Musa Al Kazim, the life of Bari Imam is known \"essentially through oral tradition and hagiographical booklets and celebrated in numerous songs\" of Indian and Pakistani Sufism. In the present day, Bari Imam is one of the most popular and widely venerated saints of Punjab.\n\nBari Imam was eight years old when his family migrated to what is now Aabpara, Islamabad in Pakistan. According to some sources, he later married and had one daughter, though both women are said to have died prematurely. After their passing, Bari Imam began wandering the forests of the Hazara district in Northern Punjab, where he spent twenty-four years as an ascetic.\n\nBecause Bari Imam Sarkar did not transmit any of his doctrines to writing; as such, it may be rightly presumed that he bequeathed all of his teachings orally. Bari Imam went to Ghorghushti in Campbellpur (now known as Attock) where he stayed for two years to learning fiqh, hadith, logic, and other disciplines related to Islam, because at that time Ghorghushti was a great seat of Islamic learning. Bari Imam was renowned in his own life for being an ascetic who subjected himself to great self-humiliation in the public sphere, \"living among the pariahs and consciously exposing himself to the disdain of the people.\"\n\nA celebrated miracle worker, Bari Imam is also described in regional lore as one through whom God performed many marvels to convince the local people of the truth of Islam; thus, some of the most popular miracles ascribed to him are his having caused water to gush forth from rocks and his having brought back to life the dead buffaloes of a peasant who had earlier provided the saint with milk during his ten years of spiritual seclusion.\n\nThe Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who revered Bari Sarkar originally built the silver-mirrored shrine of Bari Imam in 17th century. It has since been renovated many times, and is now maintained by the Government of Pakistan. Until the 1960s, the shrine was famous for its urs celebration, when the death anniversary of the saint was commemorated and which was attended by hundreds of thousands of people each year (in one particularly populous year, the attendance is said to have been 1.2 million people).\n\nIn May 2005, (the shrine of Imam Bari) in the village of Noorpur Shahan, Islamabad suffered a vicious terrorist act at the hands of terrorists that left 20 people dead and almost 70 injured.\n\n\n * \"Shrine of Shah Abdul Latif Kazmi (Bari Imam)\"\n * \"Syed Shah Abdul Latif: 'Khushki kay Imam'\"\n * \"Mausoleum (Mazar) of Shah Abdul Latif (Bari Imam)\"\n * Urs of Bari Imam\n * Tomb of Bari Imam\n * Bari Imam - A Great Sufi\n * The Shrine of Bari Imam\n * Urs Inauguration by Prime Minister\n * Bari Imam",

      "description": "Faisal Mosque (undefined) is a mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is located on the foothills of Margalla Hills in Islamabad, the mosque features a contemporary design consisting of eight sides of concrete shell and is inspired by a Bedouin tent. The mosque is a major tourist attraction, and is referred as a contemporary and influential feature of Islamic architecture.\n\nConstruction of the mosque began in 1976 after a $120 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose name the mosque bears. The unconventional design by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay was selected after an international competition. Without a typical dome, the mosque is shaped like a Bedouin tent, surrounded by four 260 ft tall minarets. The design features eight-sided shell shaped sloping roofs forming a triangular worship hall which can hold 10,000 worshippers.\n\nCombined the structure covers an area of 54,000 square ft, the mosque dominates the landscape of Islamabad. It is situated at the north end of Faisal Avenue, putting it at the northernmost end of the city and at the foot of Margalla Hills, the westernmost foothills of the Himalayas. It is located on an elevated area of land against a picturesque backdrop of the national park. The largest mosque in Pakistan, the Faisal Mosque was the largest mosque in the world from 1986 until 1993, when it was overtaken by mosques in MENA region. Faisal Mosque is now the fourth largest mosque in terms of capacity.\n\nThe impetus for the mosque began in 1966 when King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz supported the initiative of the Pakistani Government to build a national mosque in Islamabad during an official visit to Pakistan.\n\nIn 1969, an international competition was held in which architects from 17 countries submitted 43 proposals. The winning design was that of Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay. Construction of the mosque began in 1976 by National Construction Limited of Pakistan, led by Azim Khan and was funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, at a cost of over 130 million Saudi riyals (approximately 120 million USD today). King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz was instrumental in the funding, and both the mosque and the road leading to it were named after him after his assassination in 1975. The mosque was completed in 1986, and used to house the International Islamic University. Many conservative Muslims criticised the design at first for its unconventional design and lack of a traditional Dome structure.\n\nThe Faisal Mosque can accommodate about 10,000 worshippers in its main prayer hall, 24,000 in its porticoes, and 40,000 in its courtyard. Each of the Mosque's four minarets are 79 m high (the tallest minarets in South Asia) and measure 10&times;10 metres in circumference.\n\n\"I tried to capture the spirit, proportion and geometry of Kaaba in a purely abstract manner. Imagine the apex of each of the four minarets as a scaled explosion of four highest corners of Kaaba – thus an unseen Kaaba form is bounded by the minarets at the four corners in a proportion of height to base. Shah Faisal Mosque akin to Kaaba.Now, if you join the apex of each minaret to the base of the minaret diagonally opposite to it correspondingly, a four-sided pyramid shall be bound by these lines at the base side within that invisible cube. That lower level pyramid is treated as a solid body while four minarets with their apex complete the imaginary cube of Kaaba.\"\n\n- Vedat Dalokay Instead of using traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay designed an eight sided main hall that looked like an Arab's Bedouin desert tent. Additionally, he added four minarets on all four corners of the main hall, which are of 80 m high, the tallest minarets in South Asia. The main structure of the building is the main prayer hall, which is supported by four concrete girders. The four unusual minarets are inspired by Turkish architecture. Vedat Dalokay also believed that the design of the Masjid represents Kaaba in an abstract manner. Entrance is from the east, where the prayer hall is fronted by a courtyard with porticoes. The International Islamic University was housed under the main courtyard, but now has relocated to a new campus. The mosque still houses a library, lecture hall, museum and cafe. The interior of the main tent-shaped hall is covered in white marble and decorated with mosaics and calligraphy by the famous Pakistani artist Sadequain, and a spectacular Turkish-style chandelier. The mosaic pattern adorns the west wall, and has the Kalimah written in early Kufic script, repeated in mirror image pattern.\n\nThe Faisal Mosque is described in the book The Kite Runner by Khalid Hosseini, and is frequently referenced in the work of Michael Muhammad Knight, who came to the mosque to study Islam as a teenager.\n\nHover your mouse over or tap the images below to see their captions.\n\n\n * Badshahi Mosque\n * Islamic art\n * List of mosques in Pakistan\n * List of largest mosques\n * List of things named after Saudi Kings\n * Timeline of Muslim history\n\n* Shah Faisal Mosque: Google 3D Warehouse",

      "title": "National Institutes of Health",
      "description": "The National Institutes of Health (NIH) (each letter separately) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. It was founded in the late 1870s, and is now part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The majority of NIH facilities are located in Bethesda, Maryland. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.\n\n, the IRP had 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world, while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.\n\nThe NIH comprises 27 separate institutes and centers of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar disorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, Haemophilus influenzae (HIB), and human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nIn 2019, the NIH was ranked #2 in the world for biomedical sciences by the Nature Index, which measured the largest contributors to papers published in a subset of leading journals from 2015-2018.\n\n\n\nNIH's roots extend back to the Marine Hospital Service in the late 1790s that provided medical relief to sick and disabled men in the U.S. Navy. By 1870, a network of marine hospitals had developed and was placed under the charge of a medical officer within the Bureau of the Treasury Department. In the late 1870s, Congress allocated funds to investigate the causes of epidemics like cholera and yellow fever, and it created the National Board of Health, making medical research an official government initiative. In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York. In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at Harvard Medical School. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the Ransdell Act, and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings. Over the next few decades, Congress would increase funding tremendously to the NIH, and various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs. In 1944, the Public Health Service Act was approved, and the National Cancer Institute became a division of NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher Chester M. Southam injected HeLa cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention. The NIH was a major source of funding for Southam's research and had required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent prior to any experimentation. Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.\n\nIn 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding in order to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971 cancer research was in full force and President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, initiating a National Cancer Program, President's Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.\n\nFunding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities. While government funding for research in other disciplines has been increasing at a rate similar to inflation since the 1970s, research funding for the NIH nearly tripled through the 1990s and early 2000s, but has remained relatively stagnant since then.\n\nBy the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the Human Genome Project.\n\nThe NIH Office of the Director is the central office responsible for setting policy for NIH, and for planning, managing and coordinating the programs and activities of all NIH components. The NIH Director plays an active role in shaping the agency's activities and outlook. The Director is responsible for providing leadership to the Institutes and Centers by identifying needs and opportunities, especially in efforts involving multiple Institutes. Within this Office is the Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives with 12 divisions including:\n\n\n * Office of AIDS Research\n * Office of Research on Women's Health\n * Office of Disease Prevention\n * Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office\n * Tribal Heath Research Office\n * Office of Program Evaluation and Performance\n\nPrevious directors:\n * Joseph J. Kinyoun, served August 1887 – April 30, 1899\n * Milton J. Rosenau, served May 1, 1899 – September 30, 1909\n * John F. Anderson, served October 1, 1909 – November 19, 1915\n * George W. McCoy, served November 20, 1915 – January 31, 1937\n * Lewis R. Thompson, served February 1, 1937 – January 31, 1942\n * Rolla Dyer, served February 1, 1942 – September 30, 1950\n * William H.

Zerhouni, served May 2, 2002 – October 31, 2008\n * Francis S. Collins, served August 17, 2009 – present\n\nIntramural research is primarily conducted at the main campus in Bethesda, Maryland and Rockville, Maryland, and the surrounding communities.\n\nThe Bayview Campus in Baltimore, Maryland houses the research programs of the National Institute on Aging, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Human Genome Research Institute with nearly 1,000 scientists and support staff. The Frederick National Laboratory in Frederick, MD and the nearby Riverside Research Park, houses many components of the National Cancer Institute, including the Center for Cancer Research, Office of Scientific Operations, Management Operations Support Branch, the division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and the division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.\n\nThe National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is located in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina.\n\nOther ICs have satellite locations in addition to operations at the main campus. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases maintains its Rocky Mountain Labs in Hamilton, Montana, with an emphasis on BSL3 and BSL4 laboratory work. NIDKK operates the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch in Phoenix, AZ.\n\n\n\nAs of 2017, 153 scientists receiving financial support from the NIH have been awarded a Nobel Prize and 195 have been awarded a Lasker Award.\n\nNIH devotes 10% of its funding to research within its own facilities (intramural research). The institution gives 80% of its funding in research grants to extramural (outside) researchers. Of this extramural funding, a certain percentage (2.8% in 2014) must be granted to small businesses under the SBIR/STTR program. The extramural funding consists of about 50,000 grants to more than 325,000 researchers at more than 3000 institutions. , NIH spent US$10.7bn (not including temporary funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) on clinical research, US$7.4bn on genetics-related research, US$6.0bn on prevention research, US$5.8bn on cancer, and US$5.7bn on biotechnology.\n\nIn 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the National Library of Medicine's research repository, PubMed Central (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication. The NIH Public Access Policy was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.\n\nOn February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to \"coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration… and providing an important avenue for public involvement\" (\"Members of new,\" 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for arthritis sufferers.\n\nIn 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was \"instrumental\" for 15. As of 2011 NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior. One study found NIH funding aided either directly or indirectly in developing the drugs or drug targets for all of the 210 FDA-approved drugs from 2010 to 2016. In 2015, Pierre Azoulay et al. estimated $10 million invested in research generated two to three new patents.\n\nSince its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:\n * 1908 – George W. McCoy's discovery that rodents were a reservoir of bubonic plague.\n * 1911 – George W. McCoy, Charles W. Chapin, William B. Wherry, and B. H. Lamb described the previously-unknown tularemia.\n * 1924 – Roscoe R. Spencer and Ralph R. Parker developed a vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\n * 1930 – Sanford M. Rosenthal developed a treatment for mercury poisoning used widely before the development of dimercaptoethanol.\n * 1943 – Wilton R. Earle pioneered the cell culture process and published a paper describing the production of malignancy in vitro, Katherine K. Sanford developed the first clone from an isolated cancer cell, and Virginia J. Evans devised a medium that supported growth of cells in vitro.\n * 1940s-50s – Bernard Horecker and colleagues described the pentose phosphate pathway.\n * 1950s – Julius Axelrod discovered a new class of enzymes, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, a fundamental of drug metabolism.\n * 1950 – Earl Stadtman discovered phosphotransacetylose, elucidating the role of acetyl CoA in fatty acid metabolism.\n * 1960s – Discovered the first human slow virus disease, kuru, which is a degenerative, fatal infection of the central nervous system. This discovery of a new mechanism for infectious diseases revolutionized thinking in microbiology and neurology.\n * 1960s – Defined the mechanisms that regulate noradrenaline, one of the most important neurotransmitters in the brain.\n * 1960s – Developed the first licensed rubella vaccine and the first test for rubella antibodies for large scale testing.\n * 1960s – Developed an effective combination drug regimen for Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n * 1960s – Discovery that tooth decay is caused by bacteria.\n * 1970s – Developed the assay for human chorionic gonadotropin that evolved into the home pregnancy tests.\n * 1970s – Described the hormonal cycle involved in menstruation.\n * 1980s – Determined the complete structure of the IgE receptor that is involved in allergic reactions.\n * 1990s – First trial of gene therapy in humans.\n\nIn September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on Item Response Theory and adapted for testing by computer.\n\n\n\nTo allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. NIH submits its budget request to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding. This process takes approximately 18 months before the NIH can allocate any actual funds.\n\nOver the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.\n\nFunding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that \"variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),\" a new epidemic that gripped the nation. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities. From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. Since then, funding essentially remained flat, and during the decade following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.\n\nIn 1999 Congress increased the NIH's budget by $2.3 billion to $17.2 billion in 2000. In 2009 Congress again increased the NIH budget to $31 billion in 2010. In 2017 and 2018, despite President Trump's proposals to cut the NIH budget, Congress passed laws with bipartisan support that substantially increasing appropriations for NIH, which was 37.3 billion dollars annually in FY2018.\n\nResearchers at universities or other institutions outside of NIH can apply for research project grants (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships etc.). The NIH regularly issues \"requests for applications\" (RFAs), e.g., on specific programmatic priorities or timely medical problems (such as Zika virus research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for \"investigator-initiated grants\" whose subject is determined by the scientist.\n\nThe total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015. Due to this, the \"cumulative investigator rate,\" that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.\n\nR01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period. In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding. Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.\n\nNIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.\n\nAdvisory committee members advise the Institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants. The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).\n\nWhen a government shutdown occurs, the NIH continues to treat people who are already enrolled in clinical trials, but does not start any new clinical trials and does not admit new patients who are not already enrolled in a clinical trial, except for the most critically ill,  as determined by the NIH Director.\n\n\n\nOne of the goals of the NIH is to \"expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research.\" Taxpayer dollars funding NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy. However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.\n\nImportant stakeholders of the NIH funding policy include researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.\n\nPolicy changes on who receives funding significantly affects researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants, or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier. In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000–2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.\n\nThe NIH is composed of 27 separate institutes and centers (ICs) that conduct and coordinate research across different disciplines of biomedical science. These are:\n\n\n * National Cancer Institute\n * National Eye Institute\n * National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\n * National Human Genome Research Institute\n * National Institute on Aging\n * National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\n * National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n * National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases\n * National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering\n\n\n * National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\n * National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders\n * National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research\n * National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n * National Institute on Drug Abuse\n * National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences\n * National Institute of General Medical Sciences\n * National Institute of Mental Health\n * National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities\n\n\n * National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke\n * National Institute of Nursing Research\n * National Library of Medicine\n * Center for Information Technology\n * Center for Scientific Review\n * Fogarty International Center\n * National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences\n * National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health\n * NIH Clinical Center\n\nIn addition, the National Center for Research Resources operated from April 13, 1962 to December 23, 2011.\n\n\n * List of institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health\n * United States Public Health Service\n * National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale\n * Heads of International Research Organizations\n * NIH Toolbox\n\n\n\n* Regional Medical Programs Collection of information on NIH's Regional Medical Programs, from the National Library of Medicine\n * National Institutes of Health in the Federal Register\n * Regional Medical Programs Collection of information on NIH's Regional Medical Programs, from the National Library of Medicine\n\n",

      "title": "Supreme Court of Pakistan",
      "description": "The Supreme Court of Pakistan (undefined; Adālat-e-Uzma Pākistān) is the apex court in the of Pakistan.\n\nEstablished in accordance to the  Part VII of the Constitution of Pakistan, it has ultimate and extensive appellate, original, and advisory jurisdictions on all courts (including the high courts, district, special and Shariat court), involving issues of laws and may act on the verdicts rendered on the cases in context in which it enjoys jurisdiction. In the court system of Pakistan, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes as well as final interpreter of constitutional law, and the highest court of appeal in Pakistan.\n\nIn its modern composition, the Supreme Court is incorporated of Chief Justice of Pakistan, sixteen justices and two ad-hoc who are confirmed to their appointment by the President upon their nominations from the Prime Minister's selection based on their merited qualifications. Once appointed, justices are expected to completed a designated term and then retire at 65 years old, unless their term is terminated through resignation or impeachment by the Supreme Judicial Council resulted in a presidential reference in regards to the misconduct of judge(s). In their discourse judgement, the justices are often categorized as having the conservative, textual, moderate, and liberal philosophies of law in their judicial interpretation of law and judgements.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a permanent seat in Islamabad and meets at the Supreme Court Building at the Constitution Avenue. The Pakistan Supreme Court has been blamed for endangering democracy in Pakistan. It has justified military takeovers of the government and execuation of a former prime minister deposed by the military.\n\nIn 1861, the British government in India enacted the Indian High Courts Act that created the high courts in all over the Indian subcontinent in various provinces while abolishing the supreme courts Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Lahore, and also the Panchayati system in autonomous presidencies.\n\nUntil the enactment of the Government of India Act in 1935 that created the Federal Court, these new high courts had the distinctionary powers of being the highest Courts for all cases. The Federal Court had wide range of jurisdictions to resolve disputes between the provinces, presidencies, and the British government of India, often hearing appeals against judgements of the High Courts.\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan as an aftermath of British partition of India in 1947, the Federal Court was also partitioned between India and Pakistan as Justice Sir Harilal Kania became the first Chief Justice of India and Justice Sir Abdul Rashid becoming the first Chief Justice of Pakistan.\n\nWhile the tradition of British law culture continues to remain an integral part of the judiciary, the modern existence of the Supreme Court of Pakistan came when the first set of the Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated on 23 March 1956. The ratification of the Constitution of Pakistan reestablished the Supreme Court in 1956, replacing the name \"Federal Court\" to \"Supreme Court\", initially had its seat in Karachi where the Sindh High Court exists now. In successive years, the Supreme Court was moved to Lahore High Court until the Supreme Court was permanently moved into its new building constructed in Islamabad in 1964.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court was established pursuant to the Government of India Act, 1947, the modern structure of the court was reestablished by the second set in 1956, and restructured by the Constitution of Pakistan in 1973 where a significant part of the Constitution is dedicated towards the restructuring of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Part VII of the Constitution, ranges from articles 176 through 191, deals with the powers, composition, rules, and responsibilities of the Supreme Court.\n\nThese articles concern:\n * Article 176 – Composition of the Court\n * Article 177 – Appointment and qualifications of the Chief Justice\n * Article 178 – Oath of office\n * Article 179 – Retirement\n * Article 180 – Vacancy, absence, or inability of the Chief Justice\n * Article 181 – Vacancy, absence, or inability of other justices\n * Article 182 – Ad hoc appointments of justices\n * Article 183 – Location of Court\n * Article 184 – Jurisdiction in a dispute between two or more governments\n * Article 185 – Jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals\n * Article 186 – If requested, advise the President on important matters of law\n * Article 186A – Authority to transfer venue\n * Article 187 – Orders and subpoenas\n * Article 188 – Power to review its own judgements and orders\n * Article 189 – Binding nature of Supreme Court's decisions on all other Pakistani Courts\n * Article 190 – All executive and judicial authorities in Pakistan bound to aid the Supreme Court\n\nThe Part VII of the Constitution of Pakistan reconstituted the composition of Supreme Court and the high courts but it does not specify the number of justices to be served in the Supreme Court. Qualifications to be served as a supreme court justice are strictly imposed that are based on merit, personal intellecutualism, and experiences as a judge in the high courts.\n\nIn 1947, the Supreme Court consisted of a Chief Justice and six senior judges from Sindh, Punjab, NWFP, Balochistan, and East Bengal. Over the several successive years, the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, leading the Supreme Court requesting the Parliament to increase the number of judges. As the number of the justices has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a division bench ), however, coming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law.\n\nThe nomination of justices in the Supreme Court comes from an executive selection made by the Prime Minister based on judges' merited qualifications, personal intellectualism, and experiences as judge in high courts. The President then confirms the nomination summary and eventually appoints the Chief Justice and judges in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Constitution states that a nominee is not eligible unless he is:\n\nSince the 1990s, the nomination and confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the print press and electronic media, as news media often comments on the executive's selection for the appointment. Appointments of Chief Justices Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, S.A. Shah, Iftikhar Chaudhry, Faisal Arab, and T.H. Jillani have gain prominent attention from media in all over the country, mainly due to their ideological and philosophical leanings.\n * A citizen of Pakistan who:\n * has for a period of, or for periods aggregating, not less than five years been a judge of a High Court (including a High Court which existed in Pakistan at any time before the commencing day); or\n * has for a period of, or for periods aggregating not less than fifteen years been an advocate of a High Court (including a High Court which existed in Pakistan at any time before the commencing day).\n\nFurthermore, the major and influential recommendations for judges to be elevated at the Supreme Court as justices comes from the Judicial Commission that is chaired by the Chief Justice of Pakistan who prepares the qualification summary before the nomination sent to executive.\n\nThere has been Ad hoc appointment in the supreme court made when the quorum of Judges is not possible to complete the sitting number of justices in the court, or if it is necessary to increase the number of justices in the Supreme Court. The nomination comes directly from the Judicial Commission chiared by the Chief Justice who prepares the nomination summary as President confirms their appointments.\n\nAs of current, there are two justices are on the ad-hoc appointment that are from the Federal Sharia Court.\n\nA judge of the Supreme Court can be removed under the Constitution only on grounds of proven misconduct or incapacity and by an order of the President of Pakistan. A written reference has to be sent to the Supreme Judicial Council that will conduct the hearings of allegations of misconduct that would determine the removal of judge.\n\nThe Judicial Commission determines the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the Supreme Court justices. A Supreme Court justice gets ₨. 558,907.00 ($5,333.85) with additional allowances of ₨. 259,009.00 ($2471.81). Other benefits include the free housing and medical treatment as well as tax-free electricity bills. A judge who has retired as a justice of the Supreme Court is debarred from practising in any court of law or before any other authority in Pakistan.\n\nThe Supreme Court has the explicit de jure powers and enjoys the powerful judicial independence to block the exercise of certain Prime Minister's executive powers or Parliament's legislative powers that repugnant to Constitution. The Supreme Court has maintained its institutional integrity and has been able to maintain its authority to some degree in the face of martial law in Pakistan in last decades.\n\nIn another example of a de jure power granted to the Court, article 17 of the Constitution states:\n\n\"Every citizen, not being in the service of (State of) Pakistan, shall have the right to form or be a member of a political party, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan and such law shall provide that where the Government declare that any political party has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, the Federal Government shall, within fifteen days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court whose decision on such reference shall be final.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court thus provides, in principle, an important safeguard against the abuse of laws that could potentially have politically repressive consequences or in clear violation of human rights.\n\nThe Constitution also allows the Supreme Court to exercise powers and take sua sponte actions against the person, regardless of its statue, or the authority, of being disobedient to or disrespectful towards the Supreme Court, its justices, and its officers in the form of behavior that opposes or defies the Supreme Court's institutional integrity and popular authority.\n\nIn 1997, Chief Justice S.A. Shah found Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of contempt of court but the order itself was voided by the Supreme Judicial Council. In 2012, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry retroactively barred Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani of holding the office after the latter was found of in charges of court of contempt and refusing to follow the court's orders.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court took suo motu actions against populist Imran Khan of criticising against the judgement of the Supreme Court's senior judges in regards to the elections. The case was later dropped when Attorney-General assured the Supreme Court justices that Imran Khan did not insubordinate the judiciary.\n\nIn practice awarded by Constitution, judges of the supreme court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. The Constitution allows the judges to be appointed at the Supreme Court regardless of colour, race, and religious sect. Justices A.S.M. Akram, Fazal Akbar, Amin Ahmed, Abdus Sattar, Hameedur Rahman, and Hamoodur Rahman (Chief Justice) were the Bengali/Bihari jurists who served as senior justices in the Supreme Court. In 1960, Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius became the first Christian to be served as Chief Justice, while George Constantine also served in the Court.\n\nIn the 1970s–1980s, Justice Dorab Patel was the first Zorastrian, followed by Justice Rustom Sidwa who served as Supreme Court justice from 1989 until 1993. Justice Rana Bhagwandas was the first Hindu jurist who has distinction being the Chief Justice of Pakistan in 2007. Justice Qazi Faez Isa is of the Hazara descent who is currently serving as the justice of the Supreme court.\n\nThe jurists/judges do not represent or receive the official political endorsements from the nation's political parties which is an acceptable professional practice in the executive branch of the government. As their American counterparts in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Jurists philosophical leanings in the Supreme Court are often categorized as conservative, moderate, liberal, and textualist that reflected in their judicial interpretation of the judgements in the impending cases of importance.\n\nIn 1947, Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah confirmed the nomination of Justice Sir Abdul Rashid, at the behest of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali-Khan, was said to be a national conservative leanings in his judgement. His successor, Chief Justice Muh'd Munir, was a liberal in his jurisprudence but sided with conservative judgement when validated dissolution of the first Constituent Assembly in 1954 and the National Assembly in 1958 in the light of doctrine of necessity. Under the Chief Justice Muh'd Shahabuddin, the Supreme Court had the conservative leanings in regards to the constitutionalism and their judgements in the cases of important issues. Chief Justice Shahabuddin plays a crucial role in drafting the second set of the Constitution of Pakistan which incorporated the liberal ideas with the important Islamic provisions.\n\nIn 1960, President Ayub Khan appointed Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius who took much liberal approach in his jurisprudence when deciding cases on fundamental rights against the executive overreach. Justice Cornelius led Supreme Court's verdicts on many constitutional cases were carefully sided with the Islamic ideas but provided much broader role of liberal ideas to safeguard the fundamental rights ordinary citizens while being critical of the state emergency.\n\nIn 1968, the Supreme Court greatly divided when Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman presided the case hearings after President Yahya Khan declared martial law and suspended the writ of the constitution. In the views of Chief Justice Rahman, the martial law was invalid and notably ruled that Yahya Khan's assumption of power was \"illegal usurpation\". The Supreme Court also overruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958. Despite rulings, there was a split decision between the moderation justices, including Chief Justice Rahman, and conservative leaning justices of the Supreme Court who \"condoned\" the actions in the light of \"doctrine of necessity\". The de jure powers of the Supreme Court has increased since presiding the War Enquiry Commission in 1974, intervening in events that Supreme Court justices viewed as violation of human rights by the executive's authorities.\n\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court had again legalized the martial law in 1977 in the light of \"doctrine of necessity\" and denied took petitions to review its decision. During this time, Supreme Court justices were described as notoriously conservatives and only few moderates, appointed by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as his role as President in 1971–73. The Supreme Court, however, did took the petitions to review the case of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, after his counsels filed an appeal against the verdict of Lahore High Court. The Constitution Bench formed under Chief Justice Sh. Anwarul Haq, had contained Justice Muhammad Akram, Justice Dorab Patel, Justice Mohammad Haleem, Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, Justice Ghulam safdar Shah, Justice Kareem Illahi, Justice Waheedudin Ahmad, and Justice Kaisar Khan. By 1979, the Supreme Court greatly divided with Justice Dorab Patel, Justice G.S. Shah, and Justice Moh'd Haleem, who had the moderate and liberal leanings in their jurisprudence strongly disagreed with Bhutto's sentence of Capital punishment. On the other hand, Chief Justice Haq, Justice N.H. Shah, Justice Waheedudin Ahmad, and Justice Kaisar Khan, were described as having conservative/texualist ideology in their rulings and found Bhutto suitable for capital punishment; hench, marking a split decision by 4:3.\n\nIn 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto controversially elevated the Supreme Court jurist, SA Shah, who had known for his liberal jurisprudence, as Chief Justice over two senior ranking jurists at the Supreme Court. However, Justice Shah's judicial leanings did not protected the Benazir' administration when it was dismissed by President Farooq Leghari over allegations on corruption. In 1997, judicial crises reached its peak when Supreme Judicial Council took up the case against Justice Shah's appointment who eventually resigned from his office and succeeded by conservative jurist Ajmal Mian, only to be replaced with conservative jurist Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui as the new Chief Justice.\n\nOn 12 October 1999, the Supreme Court partially validated the martial law in the light of \"doctrine of necessity\" on the technicality but Chief Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui decided to hear the petitions over the legality of the martial law. Although, the Supreme Court had only validated the martial law for three-years only, the Supreme Court's jurists and Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui in clear view of this coup as a \"violation of constitution\" as Sharif's lawyers made a ground base for finding Musharraf of treason.\n\nGeneral Musharraf, acting as Chief Executive, forcefully retired the conservative leaning jurists and elevated the judges who had known to have libertarian views in their jurisprudence at the Supreme Court, including Justice Irshad Hasan as Chief Justice. In 2002, The Supreme Court supervised the general elections successfully oversaw the transition of power from the office of Chief Executive to Prime minister. The legalization of Contempt of court act further strengthened the judicial independence of the Supreme Court in 2004 when Shaukat Aziz became prime minister.\n\nThe justices and jurists of the supreme court are set to retire at the age of 65, unless the jurists sooner resign or are removed from office, or records written reasons for deviating from this rule in accordance with the Constitution. By an act of parliament of 1997, there is a fixed number of justices at 17 and, as of current, there are currently sixteen judges and one vacancy that is yet to fill. There are two ad-hoc appointment of the jurists from the Federal Shariat Court to assist with religiosity concerned cases.\n\n\n\nAs of current formation, Asif Saeed Khan Khosa is currently tenuring as the Chief Justice of Pakistan, having being appointed on 18 January 2019. The Supreme Court is currently composed of the following Justices (in order of seniority), that included the seventeen regular judges including the Chief Justice and two ad-hoc judges who were reappointed again after their retirement.\n\nThe ad-hoc appointments are due to fill the Shariat Appellate Bench that is composed on legal scholars that has expertised on Islamic jurisprudence since its establishment in 1980. The ad-hoc appointments for this bench are drawn either from the Federal Shariat Court or from among the Clergy. Decisions made the Federal Shariat Court may be appealed to the Appellate Bench, as the Appellate Bench of Supreme Court is the final authority on Islamic interpretation of law in Pakistan.\n\nThe registry of the Supreme Court is its appointed officers who is assisted by registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, gazetted officers, and other law clerks. The registry branches provides speedy justice of all nature of crimes and disputes to the people living in remote areas in the country, while keeping the civil registry of the people.\n\nThere are five registry of the supreme court: Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta.\n\nThe Officers and Registrars are appointed by the supreme court with the approval from the Chief Justices of High Courts and the President and may make rules providing for the appointment by for their terms and conditions of employment that is granted by the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court has an extensive competitive program for the appointment of the law clerks and research associates at the Supreme Court Library. The Supreme Court hires the law clerks based on the recommendations provided by their professors from their respected universities and colleges. Law clerks reviews the petitions for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions, and reported back to the supreme court's administrative registrar. As of current, the supreme court has 10 law clerks for the 2016–17 year.\n\nThe Pakistan Bar Council provides qualification for senior advocates, barristers, lawyers, and selected civil court judges to be elevated as Advocate Supreme Court (ASC) based on individual experience, qualifications, and selected invitations.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court Building is located at the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad, flanked by the Prime Minister's Office to the south, the Presidential Palace and the Parliament Building to the north.\n\nInitially, the Supreme Court met in Karachi and later moved to Lahore/Rawalpindi on various location until 1960 after the government moved to Islamabad. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Islamabad Police, maintaining the law and order as well as campus security of the court.\n\nThe Supreme Court Building is designed by the renowned Japanese architect, Kenzo Tange, in a modernist style complimenting the Parliament Building. The CDA Engineering and the Environmental Protection Agency supervised the engineering the Supreme Court's monument and civil works infrastructure throughout its lengthy construction since the 1960s. In the 1980s–90s, CDA Engineering later expanded infrastructure of the Supreme Court especially when building the Supreme Court's law library. |\n\nThe Court Complex is comprised on Main Central Block, Judges Chamber's block, and Administrative Block, covering 339,861sq. ft 2 . Administration of the Court is supervised by the Chief Justice who exercise the powers through the Registrars, Law clerks, Librarians, and private secretaries to run the judicial functions in proper manner.\n\nThe Court complex judges' chambers, a separate building consisting of the law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a lecture auditorium. There is an Elizabethan-styled entrance hall, cafeteria, conference rooms, and a vintage Dining Hall, that resembles the Victorian era. The Supreme Court Library contains the collection of 72,000 law books, reports and journals is situated in the basement.\n\nSupreme Court Museum: The Supreme Court Museum serves as an invaluable repository for preserving the Judicial History of Post and pre-Independence era for future generation. The Museum's collections include fine arts, oral histories, photographs, personal belongings of Hon’ble Judges and Chief Justices and an archival collection of rare documents. These collections are displayed in the permanent exhibit gallery of the Museum, as well as in temporary exhibits; surely in future these archival materials will be assets to the researchers. The idea of Supreme Court Museum was dreamt in year 2010 by Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani and completed in the June 2016.\n\nThe Supreme Court has all the original, appellate, and advisory jurisdiction on all of country's courts– hence, the Supreme Court is the final arbitrator of all cases where the decision has been reached. In 1976, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was constrained and limited by the passing of Fifth Amendment to the Constitution but its powers were originally restored in 1985 through the Eighth Amendment, which further expanded the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court enjoys a powerful jurisdiction in the country including on the federal government, provincial governments, governmental agencies, NGOs, and where the government and governmental agencies fails to perform its mandated duty to protect the basic human rights or deviating from the law in light of taking the Suo motu notice.\n\nFrom 2008–2013, the Supreme Court repeatedly exercise its suo motu power in a view of check and balance on the governmental authorities to prevent abuse of human rights and to prevent the miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe independent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is taken as positive by the legal observers as an attempt of providing a fair, speedy, and public trial of authorities accused of abusing the basic human rights. Commenting of the issue of suo motu, Justice K.M. Sharif critically opined: \"[Supreme Court]'s jurisdiction will take notice of every matter in which the executive is showing slackness.\" The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over the direct appeals from high courts decisions, as powers granted by the Constitution as an appellate jurisdiction.\n\nThe Supreme Court also has an original jurisdiction in any dispute between any two or more provincial governments or the Government of Pakistan itself where the Supreme Court may pronounce declaratory judgments only to settle the disputes. However, almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal, making the cases considered based on original jurisdiction rarely. On events involving the legal and technical issues concerning the implementation of law and the writ of constitution, Supreme Court has an advisory jurisdiction to answer questions and provides written opinions on public importance as consulted by the President upon the request from the Prime Minister.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court also enjoys the plenary jurisdiction and may exercise its plenary powers for passing appropriate orders to ensure the completion of its orders and to complete the justice at all levels of commands.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court is empowers to frame its own rules for the purpose of regulating the practice and procedure of the Court. When the cases are determined as their final rulings, the jurists deliver their rulings in an open court, either at once or may announced future date to the concerning parties through their advocates upon writing their opinions during their recesses.\n\nAll cases that comes before the supreme court through the writs of certiorari that are processed through the law clerks and advocates. The Supreme Court has powers to transfer any case, appeals, or other pendings proceedings before any High Courts to any subordinated court if the supreme court considers it expedient to do so in the interest of justice and speedy trial. The Supreme Court may issues advisory directions, orders, and decrees in any case or matter pending in the high courts necessary for doing the complete justice, including an order for the purpose of securing the attendance of any person or the discovery or production of any document. The directions and orders issued by the Supreme Court are finals despite questions are arises during the hearings in the High Court for the directions provided the Supreme court.\n\nWhen the cert petitions are granted by the Supreme Court, the case is then set for the oral arguments, issuing orders to advocates of concerning parties in the case of importance. If the parties, despite the opportunity granted by the court to make oral submissions, do not avail the same, the court is not bound to wait indefinitely for them and keep on adjourning the matter. During the time of the orality by either sides of the parties, the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded.\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for the final judgements where cases are decided by majority vote of the Justices. It is possible that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly on a case, as such happened on the case Nusrat Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan (1977–78).\n\nDespite its final rulings, the Supreme Court may review any case upon the filing of review petition of any party to any civil and criminal case of any decisions, judgements/rulings have been pronounced by the Supreme Court. The party that filed an appealed through the supreme court advocates to the Supreme Court is the Appellant and the non-mover is the respondent, where all case names before the Supreme Court are styled \"petitioner/appellant vs. defendants/respondent\".\n\nAll decisions that are pronounced by the supreme court, after hearing the review petitions, are considered as final rulings that are to be binding on all other courts in Pakistan. The Constitution also empowers the Supreme Court to call upon any authority, either an executive or judicial, to act in aid of the Supreme Court to ensure its rulings are delivered to complete justice.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan Press is the official authority that publishes the reportable Supreme Court's decisions and opinions, as well as judicial supplements, law reports, and bibliographies. The Supreme Court's opinions are first published and is made available on the Court's web site, in form of \"press release.\" Secondly, comprehensive opinions and orders are bound together in paperback form in which the final version of the Court's opinions appears which is called a preliminary print of \"Annual Report\".\n\nAbout a year after the paperbacks are published, a final and more cited volume of decision of supreme court volume of Annual Report is published and numbered whereas the researchers may cite the works in their reports.\n\nAll supreme court advocates are required to be a member of the Supreme Court Bar Association in order to plead the cases before the court. Formed and established in 1989, the Bar comprises the supreme court lawyers who are elected from all over the country and is aimed to uphold the rule of law, cause of justice and protect the interest of the legal profession as well as that of public.\n\nThe Bar is governed by an executive council consisting of 22 elected members with an elected President. Advocate can be admitted as either individuals or as groups and their admission is approves by the elected President of the Bar. Members of the Supreme Court Bar Association are also granted access to the Supreme Court Library's research collection and law periodicals.\n\nThe Supreme Court has played an influential and pivotal role in the political history of the country since its inception in 1947, and has taken constitutional role for protecting the rights in the light of \"doctrine of necessity\". The de jure institutional powers of the Supreme Court as outlined in the Constitution can only be understood as an exemplary of constitutional cases involving the actions of the Pakistan's military turning over the civilian government in an attempt to restore law and order to prevent chaos in the society.\n\nIn 1954, the Court under Chief Justice Moh'd Munir exercised its institutional power in a supreme court case (Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan vs. Federation of Pakistan) when it validated the dismissal of Constituent Assembly, whereas M.A. Bogra continued to serve as Prime Minister under Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam. There were three constitutional cases overheard by the Supreme Court:\n\n\n * 1) Federation of Pakistan et al v. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan\n * 2) Usil Patel v. Two others v. The Crown\n * 3) Special Reference made by the Governor-General of Pakistan\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court validated the Governor-General's actions in case 1 but soon considered such powers as Ultra vires in case 2 and case 3. However, the Court found it legal in its jurisdiction in thrice cases when it validated the actions under the impression of \"doctrine of necessity\". Despite its rulings, the Court maintained its institutional authority over the Governor-General's actions and ultimately supervised the election of the Constituent Assembly which was transformed into National Assembly of Parliament that promulgated the first set of Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1969, Supreme Court justices again heard the petitions against the suspension of the second set of the Constitution when army chief General Yahya Khan took over the presidency amid the resignation of President Ayub Khan. This constitutional case cited as, \"Asma Jillani v. Government of the Punjab\", evenly divided the justices on this issue but bitterly approved such actions in the light of \"necessity doctrine\", with Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman critically opined against this actions as he notably ruled that Yahya Khan's assumption of power was \"illegal usurpation\". In doing so, the Supreme Court also overruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958.\n\nThe institutional influence of Supreme Court on the political events in the country grew since 1971 after the conclusion of the War Enquiry Commission that provided far reaching insightful recommendations to prevent foreign intervention. In 1975, the institutional powers of the Supreme Court were constraint after the passing of the fifth amendment that ultimately disturbed the \"checks and balances\" system in the country, that eventually strain the executive and judiciary relations. In 1977, the Supreme Court courted by Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq used the institutional powers to provide a legality to justify the actions resulted in martial law to dismiss the Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but decided to hear a petition to review the death sentence awarded by the Lahore High Court after the murder trial reached to its conclusion. In a controversial leanings of 4:3, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but it maintained its institutional integrity while taking many cases involving the Zia administration. The institutional de jure powers of the Supreme Court were restored to its original position after the passing of the Eighth Amendment in 1985.\n\nAfter the military takeover of the civilian government, the pro-democracy organizations and PML(N)'s lawyers challenged the legality of the military takeover, asking the supreme court to review its rulings. After the lengthy court battle between Sharif's and Musharraf's lawyers, the Supreme Court was in a clear view of the military take over as \"unconstitutional\" but favoured the legality on necessity grounds that was viewed as very limited, on 12 May 2000.\n\nWidely publicised case, the Nawaz Sharif vs. Federation, the supreme court relied its judgement based on the principle of salus populi est suprema lex and rejected the options of \"complete surrender\" to the regime or total opposition which, in its judgement, would have led to the \"closure of the courts\". Due to the Thirteenth Amendment removed the effective check and balance of branches of the government, the supreme court marked its reference using the \"Necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum\" and asserted on the right of the Superior Courts to review the orders, proceedings, acts, and legislative measures of the Musharraf regime. In addition, the situation was termed by the supreme court as a \"case of constitutional deviation for a transitional period\", and accepted Musharraf's argument for holding the national elections within two-to-three years, giving Musharraf until 12 May 2002 to hold new elections. While issuing a lengthy judgement, the supreme court effectively established its institutional authority on Musharraf as it reserved for its right to review and re-examine the continuation of Musharraf's emergency powers.\n\nBefore this judgement, Musharraf did not hint a timetable for the restoration of democracy – having argued that it needed an indefinite and possibly prolonged time to reform the country – Musharraf publicly submitted to the Court's judgement. Several of Pakistani legal theorists have posited that Pakistan's \"grundnorm\", the basis for its Constitutional convention and system of laws, continues in effect (and the Supreme Court therefore retains its authority) even when the written constitution is suspended by the imposition of a military dictablanda.\n\nThe Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to exercise its powers of contempt of court to punish any person or an authority found of scandalizing, abusing, interfering, and obstructing the procedures of the court or its rulings. In 2001–2002, there were additional amendments made that further empowers the Supreme Court and its institutional powers to struck any federal authority found on the charges of contempt of court.\n\nIn a much publicized case, the Supreme Court effectively used its constitutional powers when it ceased Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani from running the government when the court found him guilty of contempt of court charges– hench disqualified the prime minister from holding any public offices in the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been given literary criticism by historians and authors of history of Pakistan for validating the martial law against the elected governments of Pakistan by the military interventions.\n\nIn 2007, it was reported widely by the news media that the Military Intelligence officials, acting under then-President and army chief General Pervez Musharraf, were using photographs of the justices involved with prostitutes to blackmail and pressurize the supreme court justices to take the oath of allegiance and make rulings favorable to the then-President Musharraf.\n\nThe Lawyer's movement, allied with the Rule of Law movement led by PML(N), eventually called for a successful long march to have to justices of the supreme court restored before state of emergency imposed in 2007. Led under the direction of PML(N)'s President Nawaz Sharif, now the Prime Minister, the long march effectively restored the supreme court justices when Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani appeared on national television, only to announced the announced unconditional restoration of the judiciary.\n\nOn immediate effect on 17 March 2009, Justices Javaid Iqbal, Ijaz Ahmed, K. R. Ramday, and Fayaz Ahmad were restored to their position as of 2 November 2007 with Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry assuming the post of Chief Justice on 22 March 2009. The news media pundits eventually noted that it was General Tariq Majid, then-Chairman joint chiefs, and General Ashfaq Pervez Kiani, then-army chief, had played an ambiguous role in intervening and encouraging a rapprochement between the government and the opposition. Neither side acknowledged this role, however, until lawyers' movement leader Aitezaz Ahsan publicly admitted Kayani's role. There were mass speculations that protestors and law enforcement agencies would have violently collided otherwise had they not intervened.\n\nThe restoration of the justices that resulted from the immense public pressure led to the judiciary to begin a quest for independence with an aim to ensure a strong and efficient judicial system that could quickly deliver justice to the public. The Supreme Court took notice of several important constitutional and other cases in the period that related to the public interest. These cases of importance included the constitutional petitions and judgements on:\n * Constitution Petition No. 8 & 9 of 2009\n * Dr. Mubashir Hussain vs. Federation of Pakistan\n * Missing Person vs. the Federation of Pakistan et.al\n * Petitioners vs. Federation of Pakistan et.al\n * Steel Workers Union vs. Federation of Pakistan et.al\n * Applicants vs. NICL et.al.\n\nThe Supreme Court rendered its judgement declare the appointments based upon PCO on 3 November 2007 as null and void as well as declaring the NRO as also null and voided that ultimately opened the investigations and cases against then-President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani. The Supreme Court became extremely vigilant on corruption cases related to the Gillani administration, effectively led to the government shutdown and critics noted that the judicial activism slowed of government productivity without corruption has created a tension between the Chaudhry Court and the Gillani administration in 2008 till 2013.\n\nOf the 14 justices that rendered a verdict related to taking an oath under the PCO, 12 had taken the oath themselves. However, they controversially did not apply the judgement to themselves.\n\nAs a result of the 31 July 2009 decision handed down in the case of Constitutional Petitions 8 and 9 of 2009, the following justices resigned before their cases were referred to Supreme Judicial Council:\n\nIn addition to the above justices, the following justices were removed from the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the ground that their appointment to the court was made without consultation with the de jure Chief Justice of Pakistan.\n\nThe decision of the Court summarily removed all justices of the higher judiciary who were not part of it as of 2 November 2007. Their removal was ordered on the grounds that the de jure Chief Justice was not allowed to advise in these cases. In the same decision the court held that the de jure Chief Justice from 3 November 2007 to 22 March 2009 was Justice Chaudhry.\n\nThere were three groups of removed justices:\n * Those elevated to higher courts who initially took oath under the PCO\n * Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by Musharraf\n * Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by Asif Ali Zardari\n\nThe Supreme Court bench that rendered the decision consisted entirely of justices who had taken oath under the PCO of 1999 themselves, but were already sitting justices of the higher judiciary at the time and had taken a constitutional oath. The 1999 PCO and decisions made under it were given constitutional protection by Seventeenth amendment.\n\nThis decision has resulted in situations where:\n * 1) newly appointed justices who never took any sort of oath under any PCO have been removed\n * 2) sitting justices who took an oath under the 2007 PCO are still acting as justices, though their cases will be sent to Supreme Judicial Council\n * 3) sitting justices who were reappointed and took oath under Justice Dogar are still acting as justices with no action\n * 4) justices who took oath under the PCO of 1999 are still functioning as justices of higher judiciary\n\nCritics of the decision question the fact that some PCO judges are still working and some non-PCO judges have been sacked.\n\nRemoved ad hoc judges of the Lahore High Court have filed several petitions in the Supreme Court in Lahore for review of its judgment, which sent 76 judges of Supreme Courts and High Courts immediately home.\n\nThese judges argue that they were qualified to be appointed as judges of the High Court in accordance with the requirements of Article 193(2)of the 1973 Constitution and were offered to serve as ad hoc judges following the consultation required under the Constitution. They accepted the offer and took oath when the state of emergency was lifted. They never took oath under a PCO and continued performing the functions of judges of the High Court until judgement was rendered against them.\n\nThese judges were appointed by Lahore High Court Chief Justice Justice Zahid Hussain, who is still a justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and is not being tried before the Supreme Judicial Counsel.\n\nThe petition also noted that none of the sacked judges were made parties to the decision against them, nor were they able to comment in the hearing or in some cases aware that the hearing was taking place. They also allege that no copy of the decision was sent to the High Court or to the judges concerned.\n\nAccording one news article, the Supreme Court has applied its judgement retroactively, having effect from 3 November 2007. The 14-member Supreme Court bench has not, however, applied the sanction to judges who took oath under the 1999 PCO. Some of these are current justices, and some have not yet taken a constitutional oath.\n\nCritics of the decision also argue that it is inconsistent with the principles laid down in Malik Asad Ali's case where it was held that the Chief Justice was bound by the Court's judgement. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was removed from office based on this case.\n\nInconsistently with the decision, the present Chief Justice Chaudhry has accepted the stance of the government that Justice Dogar was the Chief Justice until his retirement.\n\nFollowing the decision, the official website of Supreme Court was hacked by an unknown person. The hacked website made derogatory remarks about Chief Justice Chaudhry.\n\n\n * The Pakistan Bar Council and the five province-level bar councils:\n * Balochistan Bar Council\n * Islamabad Bar Council\n * Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council\n * Punjab Bar Council\n * Sindh Bar Council\n * Chief Justice of Pakistan\n * Constitution of Pakistan\n * Federal Shariat Court\n * The five High Courts of Pakistan:\n * Balochistan High Court\n * Islamabad High Court\n * Lahore High Court\n * Peshawar High Court\n * Sindh High Court\n * Judiciary of Pakistan\n * Law Minister of Pakistan\n * Lists of Pakistan Supreme Court cases\n * Ministry of Justice of Pakistan\n\n\n * Supreme Court of Pakistan\n * Constitutional Supreme Court of Pakistan\n * Law and Justice Commission Government of Pakistan\n * Supreme Court of Pakistan",

      "title": "Swat District",
      "description": "Swat District (سوات ولسوالۍ, ضِلع سوات) ) is a district in Malakand Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Swat is renowned for its outstanding natural beauty. Centred upon the upper portions of the Swat River, Swat was a major centre of early Buddhist thought as part of the Gandhara kingdom, and today is littered with ruins from that era. Swat was home to the last isolated pockets of Gandharan Buddhism, which lasted until the 11th century, well after most of the area had converted to Islam. Until 1969, Swat was part of the Yusafzai State of Swat, a self-governing princely state. The region was seized by the Pakistani Taliban in late 2007, and its tourist industry decimated until Pakistani control over Swat was re-established in mid 2009.\n\nSwat's capital is Saidu Sharif, though the largest city, and main commercial centre, is the nearby city of Mingora. With a population of 2,309,570 according to the 2017 census, Swat is the 15th-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The region is inhabited largely by Pashtuns, except in the valley's uppermost reaches, where the Kohistani people dominate.\n\nSwat's average elevation is 980 m, resulting in a considerably cooler and wetter climate compared to most of Pakistan. With lush forests, verdant alpine meadows, and snow-capped mountains, Swat is one of the country's most popular tourist destinations.\n\n\n\nThe name \"Swat\" is of Sanskrit origin. One theory derives it from \"Suvastu\", the ancient name of the Swat River (Suastus in Greek literature); \"Suvastu\" literally means \"clear azure water\", and is attested in the earliest Sanskrit text, the Rigveda. Another theory derives the word Swat from the Sanskrit word \"Shveta\" (white), also used to describe the clear water of the Swat River.\n\n\n\nIn 327 BC, Alexander the Great fought his way to Odigram and Barikot and stormed their battlements. In Greek accounts these towns have been identified as Ora and Bazira. Around the 2nd century BC, the area was occupied by Buddhists, who were attracted by the peace and serenity of the land. There are many remains that testify to their skills as sculptors and architects. Later some Dilazak entered the area along with Sultans from Kunar and their tribe was styled as Swatis. The originator of the present family of Swat was the Muslim saint Akhund Abdul Gaffur, more commonly known as Saidu Baba. He was a pious man and the people respected him so greatly that they called him Akhund Sahib.\n\nHistorically known as Uddiyana, Tantric Buddhism flourished under King Indrabhuti, however, there is an old and well-known scholarly dispute as to whether Uddiyana was in the Swat valley, Orissa or some other place. Padmasambhava (flourished eighth century AD), also called Guru Rimpoche, Tibetan Slob-upon (teacher), or Padma 'Byung-gas (lotus born), semi-legendary Indian Buddhist mystic who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet was, according to tradition, native from Uddiyana. He is revered as the second Buddha in Tibet. Padmasambhava is said to be the son of Indrabhuti, king of Swat in the early eighth century AD and one of the original Siddhas. Indrabhuti's sister, Lakshminkaradevi, is also said being an accomplished Siddha of the 9th century AD.\n\nAncient Gandhara, the valley of Pekhawar, with the adjacent hilly regions of Swat and Buner, Dir and Bajaur was one of the earliest centers of Buddhist religion and culture following the reign of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, in the third century BC. The name Gandhara first occurs in the Rigveda which is usually identified with the region\n\nThe Gandhara school is credited with the first representations of the Buddha in human form, rather symbolically as the wheel of the law, the tree, etc.\n\nSwat was ruled by the Hindu Shahi dynasty, who built an extensive array of temples and other architectural buildings, now in ruins. Sanskrit may have been the lingua franca of the locals.\n\nHindu Shahi rulers built fortresses to guard and tax the commerce through this area. Their ruins can be seen in the hills of Swat: at Malakand pass at Swat's southern entrance.\n\nAt the end of the Mauryan period (324–185 BC) Buddhism spread in the whole Swat valley, which became a very famous center of Buddhist religion.\n\nAfter a Buddhist phase the Hindu religion reasserted itself, so that at the time of the Muslim conquest (1000 AD) the population was solidly Hindu.\n\n\n\nIn 1023, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked Swat and crushed the last Buddhist King, Raja Gira in battle. The invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni is of special importance because of the introduction of Islam as well as changing the Chronology.\n\nThe first Muslim arrivals in Swat were Pakhtun Dilazak tribes from south-east Afghanistan. These were later ousted by Swati Pakhtuns, who was succeeded in the sixteenth century by Yusufzai Pakhtuns. Both groups of Pakhtuns came from the Kandahar and Kabul valley.\n\nSwat Valley, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, has many Buddhist carvings, statues, and stupas. The town of Jehanabad contains a Seated Buddha statue. Kushan era Buddhist stupas and statues in Swat valley were demolished by the Taliban, and after two attempts by the Taliban, the Jehanabad Buddha's face was dynamited. Only the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, which the Taliban also demolished, were larger than the Buddha statue in Swat. The government did nothing to safeguard the statue after the initial attempt at destroying the Buddha, which did not cause permanent harm; when the second attack took place on the statue, the feet, shoulders, and face were demolished. Islamists (particularly the Taliban) and looters destroyed many of Pakistan's Buddhist artifacts, which dated to the Buddhist Gandhara civilization. The Taliban deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction. Gandhara artifacts were thereafter plundered by thieves and smugglers. In 2009, the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Diocsece of Lahore, Lawrence John Saldanha, wrote a letter to Pakistan's government denouncing the Taliban activities in Swat Valley, including their destruction of Buddha statues, and their attacks on Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus. A group of Italians helped repair the Buddha.\n\nSwat is surrounded by Chitral, Upper Dir and Lower Dir in the West, Gilgit-Baltistan in North Kohistan, Buner and Shangla in the East and South East. The southern tehsil of Buner was granted the status of a separate district in 1991. The valley of Swat is situated in the north of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and is enclosed by sky-high mountains.\n\nPhysical Features: Swat can be divided into two physical regions:\n\n\n * 1) Mountainous Ranges.\n * 2) Plains.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Swat lies in the lap of mountainous ranges, which are the offshoots of Hindukush, so the larger part of Swat is covered with high mountains and hills, the crests of which are hidden by everlasting snow. Though these gigantic ranges run irregularly: some to the west while the others to the east, but the general direction is North-South.\n\nThe length of the valley from Landakay to Gabral is 91 miles. Two narrow strips of plains run along the banks of Swat River from Landakay to Madyan. Beyond Madyan in Kohistan-e-Swat, the plain is too little to be mentioned. So far as the width concerns, it is not similar, it varies from place to place. We can say that the average width is 5 miles. The widest portion of the valley is between Barikot and Khwaza Khela. The widest viewpoint and the charming sight where a major portion of the valley is seen is at Gulibagh on the main road, which leads to Madyan.\n\nApproximately 38% of economy of Swat depends on Tourism and 31% depends on Agriculture.\n\nGwalerai village located near Mingora is one of those few villages which produces 18 varieties of apples due to its temperate climate in summer. The apple produced here is consumed in Pakistan as well as exported to other countries. It is known as ‘the apple of Swat’. Swat is famous for peach production mostly grown in the valley bottom plains and accounts for about 80% of the peach production of the country. Mostly marketed in the national markets with a brand name of \"Swat Peaches\". The supply starts from April and continues till September because of a diverse range of varieties grown.\n\nThe population of Swat District is 2,309,570 as per the 2017 census, making it the third-largest district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after Peshawar District and Mardan District. Swat is populated mostly by ethnic Pashtuns and Gujjar and Kohistani communities. The language spoken in the valley is Pashto, with a minority of Torwali and Kalami speakers in the Swat Kohistan region of Upper Swat.\n\nPashtuns of the Yusufzai,\n\nAlongside the Gujjar Nation.\n\nThe District of Swat is subdivided into 7 Tehsils i.e.\n * 1) Babuzai\n * 2) Matta\n * 3) Khwaza Khela\n * 4) Barikot\n * 5) Kabal\n * 6) Charbagh\n * 7) Bahrain\n\nEach Tehsil comprises certain numbers of Union councils. There are 65 Union councils in District Swat: 56 rural and 9 urban.\n\nAccording to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Act 2013. There were new system introduced called as Local Governments which have District Swat has 67 Wards, of which total amount of Village Councils is 170, and Neighbourhood Councils is 44.\n\nThe region elects three male members of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNAs), one female MNA, seven male members of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (MPAs) and two female MPAS. In the 2002 National and Provincial elections, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, an alliance of religious political parties, won all the seats.\n\n\n\nMarghazar 16 km away from Saidu Sharif is famous for its Sufed Mahal the white marble palace built by the first Wali (ruler) of Swat. It used to be the ruler's summer residence. Elizabeth II (Queen of England) and Prince Philip (Duke of Edinburgh) were also hosted there in 1961. Elizabeth II described it as \"the Switzerland of the East\" during the visit. The marble used to build White Palace was the same marble which was used to build Taj Mahal. It was turned into a hotel.\n\nFizagat Park is a recreation arena for the tourists and the locals situated at 1 kilometre from Mingora city. Situated along the bank of the River Swat, tourists enjoy the bath and pleasant climate in summer.\n\nMalam Jabba (also Maalam Jabba, Urdu: مالم جبہ) is a Hill Station in the lower Swat mountain ranges nearly 42 km from Saidu Sharif in Swat Valley, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. It is 314 km from Islamabad and 51 km from Saidu Sharif Airport. Malam Jabba is home to the largest ski resort in Pakistan. On the main Madyan-Kalam road, the road turns to the right at Manglor town (12 km from Saidu Sharif), for the Malam-Jabba Dara which has a series of small villages and settlements like Salanda, Jehanabad, Talegraam, Badar, Ser, Malam, Kishora, Spine Oba, and finally Jabba. Malam is a small village which comes prior to Kishora village on the main Malam-Jabba road. Malam is nearly 17 km from Manglor while Kishora is at 18 km distance. Jabba (12 km from Kishore) is the uppermost part of the whole Dara (gorge). The Malam Jabba ski resort, owned by the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, had a ski slope of about 800 m with the highest point of the slope 2804 m (pabove sea level. Malam Jabba Ski Resort was the joint effort of the Pakistan government with its Austrian counterpart. The resort was equipped with modern facilities including roller/ice-skating rinks, chair lifts, skiing platforms, telephones and snow clearing equipment. The resort was destroyed by the Taliban when they were in hold in Swat valley. Now that writ of the government has been reinstated and peace established, tourism has picked up. The government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa(KPK) has awarded the tender for rebuilding the Malam Jabba skiing resort to a private company. Skiing has already been restored and a skiing festival was held in Jan 2015.\n\nKalam,Bahrain,Madyan,Miandam, Mahodand,Gabin Jabba and Jarogo Waterfall Biha are other tourist attractions in the valley of Swat.\n\n\n * Wāli of Swat\n * Malala Yousafzai\n * Justice Nasir ul Mulk\n * Syed Allauddin\n * Afzal Khan Lala\n * Haider Ali Khan\n * Malak Jamroz Khan\n * Shaheen Sardar Ali\n * Sherin Zada\n * Rahim Khan\n * Anwar Ali\n * Mubarika Yusufzai\n * Badar Munir\n * Rahim Shah\n * Nazia Iqbal\n * Ghazala Javed\n * Jamila Ahmad\n * Murad Saeed\n * Sannan Mahboob\n * Muqadar Shah\n * Salman Khan\n * Sohail Khan\n * Arbaaz Khan\n * Alvira Khan Agnihotri\n * Salim Khan\n * Anwar Khan\n\n\n * Akhund of Swat\n * Lower Swat Valley\n * Oḍḍiyāna\n * Swat (princely state)\n * Lower Dir District\n * Upper Dir District\n * Chitral District\n * Buner District\n * Kaghan Valley\n * Kohistan District\n * 1974 Hunza earthquake\n * Operation Black Thunderstorm\n * Operation Rah-e-Rast\n * 2009 refugee crisis in Pakistan\n * Pushtu People\n\n\n * SwatValley PK Portal #SwatvalleyPK\n * Swat Valley - 5 Day Tour\n * 6 Days trip for Swat Valley\n * Uddiyana Until the Eighth Century: A Short Historical Overview -The Dharma Fellowship of his holiness Gyalwa Karmapa\n * Pictures of Swat\n\n*",

The lake is fed by melting glaciers of the surrounding mountains and gives rise to Daral Khwar which is the main left tributary of Swat River.\n\nDaral Lake is accessible only during the summer; during the winter, the trails which lead to the lake, are closed due to heavy snowfall. While in summer, it can be accessed from Bahrain in three to four hours of trekking on bare mountains, after which the trek descends down towards the East where Daral Lake is located. Alternatively, it can be approached from Gabina Jabba hill top, the most favoured trail. An unmetalled-cum-jeepable road ends at Gabina Jabba where the trekking journey begins. From here, continuous trekking for almost 4–5 hours leads to the lake.\n\n\n * Lake Saiful Muluk - Kaghan Valley\n * Dudipatsar Lake - Kaghan Valley\n * Saidgai Lake - Swat Valley\n * Mahodand Lake - Kalam Valley\n * Kundol Lake - Kalam Valley\n\n",

At an elevation of 3,224 m (10,578 feet) above sea level, the lake is located above the tree line, and is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan.\n\nSaiful Muluk is located in the Mansehra district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, about 9 km north of Naran, in the northern part of Kaghan Valley. Malika Parbat, the highest peak in the valley is near the lake.\n\nThe lake is accessible from the nearby town of Naran during the summer season but access during winter is limited.\n\nSaiful Muluk was formed by glacial moraines that blocked the water of the stream passing through the valley. The Kaghan Valley was formed in the greater Pleistocene Period dating back almost 300,000 years when the area was covered with ice. Rising temperatures and receding glaciers left a large depression where glaciers once stood. Melting water collected into the lake.\n\nThe lake has rich eco-diversity and holds many species of blue-green algae. Large brown trout are found in the lake, up to about seven kilograms. About 26 species of vascular plant exist in the area, with Asteraceae the most commonly found species. Other species commonly found in the region are: Ranunculaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae, Gramineae, Apiaceae, Leguminosae, Scrophulariaceae and Polygonaceae.\n\nThe Lake Saiful Muluk is named after a legendary prince. A fairy tale called Saif-ul-Muluk, written by the Sufi poet Mian Muhammad Bakhsh, talks of the lake.

The status of the park has been in dispute since and has become the issue of ongoing litigation between heirs of the former Mehtar and the Government of Pakistan.\n\nThe way leading to the park is quite narrow and dangerous, yet more risky during the rainy days. It is located between 1450 metre and about 5000 metre above sea level. It has an area of 7750 hectares.\n\nThis park includes three valleys. Several glaciers also lie in the park through which several springs make their way and ultimately form a stream which runs 18 kilometres. The cold water of this stream flows towards the east, into the River Chitral. The park is rich in trees particularly cedar trees. The park also serves to provide shelter to a vast bio-diversity, especially markhor, an endangered wild goat species. The subspecies, which are found in the park include the astor markhor. Despite a decline from over 500 to only around 200 individuals in the park during the 1980s, Chitral National Park still holds the largest population of the astor markhor in the world. Also present in the park in small numbers are the siberian ibex, ladakh urial, as well as the asian black bear. The snow leopard does not appear to be a permanent resident of the park, but is sometimes seen there. The tibetan wolf, red fox, yellow-throated marten and himalayan otter are all found in the park. Common birds in the park include, the bearded vulture, himalayan vulture, golden eagle, demoiselle crane, peregrine falcon, himalayan snowcock, himalayan monal, snow partridge and rock partridge.\n\nThe annual rainfall in its region is estimated to be 462 ml. In September, it rains more on the spectacular peaks surrounding the park. However, in November, the rainfall is more in the valleys and on the lower peaks. There is also snowfall during the winter season. The snow-covered white peaks enhance the beauty till June. The general weather is cold and dry. The temperature ranges from −12.2 to 43.3 °C.\n\nThe Birmoghlasht part of the park is where the former Mehtar’s Summer Fort is located. At the time of existence of the Chitral State, the Mehtar and his family use to move here in the summer and hold court. The fort was constructed in such a way that it overlooked the entire city. It stands at an elevation of over 2800 meters above sea level.\n\n\n\n\n * Chitral National Park\n * Sarhad Tourism Corporation, Government of NWFP, Pakistan",

The mosque's white marble façade is considered to be one of Peshawar's most iconic sights.\n\nThe mosque was built between 1660 and 1670, on what was the highest point in the old city.\n\nThe minarets of the Mohabbat Khan Mosque were frequently used in Sikh times for hanging prisoners. Five people per day were hanged from the minarets to correspond to the Sunni Islamic practice of praying five times per day, `as a substitute for the gallows’. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, refugee tribal elders would congregate in the mosque in order to forge unity amongst Afghans against the Soviets.\n\nThe mosque is 30,155 square feet in size. Its open courtyard has a centrally-located ablution pool and a single row of rooms lining the exterior walls.\n\nThe prayer hall occupies the west side. The hall is flanked by two tall minarets, which are divided into three sections. The façade of the prayer hall is also capped by 6 smaller decorative minarets that flank the mosque's 5 arched entryways, with an additional 2 minarets flanking the set of 6.

Kafir Kot is often referred to as \"Northern Kafir Kot,\" with the \"Southern Kafir Kot\" located in the city of Bilot, 35 kilometres to the south.\n\nAccording to the district Gazetteer of Mianwali of 1915 the remains of Kafirkot (and the nearby ruin of Mari) \"are indication of the existence of a Hindu civilization of considerable importance and antiquity\". It is located at 32°30'0N 71°19'60E\n\nThe ruin consists of two forts in the north-west of the district on small hills attached to the lower spurs of the Khasor Range, and overlooking the Indus River near the Chashma Barrage. One lies a few miles south of Kunda] and the other near Bilot.\n\nAccording to the District Gazetteer of Mianwali:\n\nThese forts are of great antiquity and interest. Their main features are an outer defensive wall, consisting of rough blocks of stone, some of great size, and various groups of buildings resembling small Hindu temples and more or less carved. These are built of a curiously honey-combed drab-coloured stone not to be found in the adjacent hills, which is said to have been brought by river all the way from Khushalgarh. The area of the forts is considerable and they could have held a fairly large garrison. The only legends attached to them relate that they were occupied by the last of the Hindu Rajas, Til and Bil; but all traces of rulers and ruled are now lost.\n\nBilot Fort is the second fort situated next to the town of Bilot Sharif and about 55 km north of Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan.

It connects the town of Landi Kotal to the Valley of Peshawar at Jamrud by traversing part of the Spin Ghar mountains. An integral part of the ancient Silk Road, it has long had substantial cultural, economic, and geopolitical significance for Eurasian trade. Throughout history, it has been an important trade route between Central Asia and South Asia and a vital strategic military choke point for various states that came to control it. The summit of the pass is 5 km inside Pakistan at Landi Kotal, while the lowest point is at Jamrud in the Valley of Peshawar. The Khyber Pass is part of Asian Highway 1 (AH1).\n\n\n\nIn a number of editions of the Indo-Aryan Migration Theory, the Indo-Aryans began relocating to India through the Khbar Pass. Well-known invasions of the area have been predominantly through the Khyber Pass, such as the invasions by Cyrus, Darius I, Genghis Khan and later Mongols such as Duwa, Qutlugh Khwaja and Kebek. Prior to the Kushan era, the Khyber Pass was not a widely used trade route.\n\nThe Khyber Pass became a critical part of the Silk Road, which connected Shanghai in the East to Cádiz on the coast of Spain. The Parthian and Roman Empires fought for control of passes such as these to gain access to the silk, jade, rhubarb, and other luxuries moving from China to Western Asia and Europe. Through the Khyber Pass, Gandhara (in present-day Pakistan) became a regional center of trade connecting Bagram in Afghanistan to Taxila in Pakistan, adding Indian luxury goods such as ivory, pepper, and textiles to the Silk Road commerce.\n\nAmong the Muslim invasions of the Indian subcontinent, the famous invaders coming through the Khyber Pass are Mahmud Ghaznavi, and the Afghan Muhammad Ghori and the Turkic-Mongols.\n\nFinally, Sikhs under Ranjit Singh captured the Khyber Pass in 1834 until they were defeated by the forces of Wazir Akbar Khan in 1837. Hari Singh Nalwa, who manned the Khyber Pass for years, became a household name in Afghanistan.\n\nTo the north of the Khyber Pass lies the country of the Mullagori tribe. To the south is Afridi Tirah, while the inhabitants of villages in the Pass itself are Afridi clansmen. Throughout the centuries the Pashtun clans, particularly the Afridis and the Afghan Shinwaris, have regarded the Pass as their own preserve and have levied a toll on travellers for safe conduct. Since this has long been their main source of income, resistance to challenges to the Shinwaris' authority has often been fierce.\n\nFor strategic reasons, after the First World War the British built a heavily engineered railway through the Pass. The Khyber Pass Railway from Jamrud, near Peshawar, to the Afghan border near Landi Kotal was opened in 1925.\n\nDuring World War II concrete \"dragon's teeth\" (tank obstacles) were erected on the valley floor due to British fears of a German tank invasion of British India. The Pass became widely known to thousands of Westerners and Japanese who traveled it in the days of the hippie trail, taking a bus or car from Kabul to the Afghan border. At the Pakistani frontier post, travelers were advised not to wander away from the road, as the location was a barely controlled Federally Administered Tribal Area. Then, after customs formalities, a quick daylight drive through the Pass was made. Monuments left by British Army units, as well as hillside forts, could be viewed from the highway.\n\nThe area of the Khyber Pass has been connected with a counterfeit arms industry, making various types of weapons known to gun collectors as Khyber Pass copies, using local steel and blacksmiths' forges.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Afghanistan, the Khyber Pass has been a major route for resupplying military armament and food to the NATO forces in the Afghan theater of conflict since the US started the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Almost 80 percent of the NATO and US supplies that are brought in by road were transported through the Khyber Pass. It has also been used to transport civilians from the Afghan side to the Pakistani one. Until the end of 2007, the route had been relatively safe since the tribes living there (mainly Afridi, a Pashtun tribe) were paid by the Pakistani government to keep the area safe. However, after that year, the Taliban began to control the region, and so there started to exist wider tensions in their political relationship.\n\nSince the end of 2008, supply convoys and depots in this western part have increasingly come under attack by elements from or supposedly sympathetic to the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nIn January 2009, Pakistan sealed off the bridge as part of a military offensive against Taliban guerrillas. This military operation was mainly focused on Jamrud, a district on the Khyber road. The target was to “dynamite or bulldoze homes belonging to men suspected of harboring or supporting Taliban militants or carrying out other illegal activities”. The result meant that more than 70 people were arrested and 45 homes were destroyed. In addition, two children and one woman were killed. As a response, in early February 2009, Taliban insurgents cut off the Khyber Pass temporarily by blowing up a key bridge.\n\nThis increasingly unstable situation in northwest Pakistan, made the US and NATO broaden supply routes, through Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan). Even the option of supplying material through the Iranian far southeastern port of Chabahar was considered.\n\nIn 2010, the already complicated relationship with Pakistan (always accused by the US of hosting the Taliban in this border area without reporting it) became tougher after the NATO forces, under the pretext of mitigating the Taliban's power over this area, executed an attack with drones over the Durand line, passing the frontier of Afghanistan and killing three Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan answered by closing the pass on 30 September which caused a convoy of several NATO trucks to queue at the closed border. This convoy was attacked by extremists apparently linked to Al Qaida which caused the destruction of more than 29 oil tankers and trucks and the killing of several soldiers. NATO chief members had to issue a formal apology to the Pakistan government so the supply traffic at this pass could be restored.\n\nIn August 2011, the activity at the Khyber pass was again halted by the Khyber Agency administration due to the more possible attacks of the insurgency over the NATO forces, which had suffered a period of large number of assaults over the trucks heading to supply the NATO and ISAF coalitions all over the frontier line. This instability made the Pakistan Oil Tanker Owners Association demand more protection from the Pakistani and US government threatening not to supply fuel for the Afghan side.\n\nA number of locations, around the world, have been named after the Khyber Pass:\n * Khyber Road in Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland is named after the Khyber Pass.\n * A suburb of Civil Lines, Delhi, India, is named after this pass.\n * 'Khyber Pass' is Cockney rhyming slang meaning 'arse'.

      "title": "Takht-i-Bahi",
      "description": "Takht-i-Bahi (undefined; \"Throne of the water spring\"), commonly mispronounced as Takht-i-Bhai (undefined; \"Brother's throne\"), is an Indo-Parthian archaeological site of an ancient Buddhist monastery in Mardan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The site is considered among the most imposing relics of Buddhism in all of Gandhara, and has been \"exceptionally well-preserved.\"\n\nThe Buddhist monastery was founded in the 1st century CE, and was in use until the 7th century. The complex is regarded by archaeologists as being particularly representative of the architecture of Buddhist monastic centers from its era. Takht-i-Bahi was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980.\n\nThe word Takht-i-Bahi may have different explanations. Local believes that site got its name from two wells on the hill or the springs nearby. In Persian, Takht means \"top\" or \"throne\" while bahi means \"spring\" or \"water\". When combined together its meaning is Spring from the Top or High Spring, and there were two springs on the top of mountains. Another meaning suggested is Throne of Origin.\n\nThe ruins are located about 15 kilometers from Mardan in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. A small fortified city, dating from the same era, sits nearby. The ruins also sit near a modern village known by the same name. It is located around 500 feet atop the small hill and around 2 km from village bazar. The surrounding area is famous for sugar cane, wheat, maize, vegetable, and orchard cultivation. Once remote and little visited, the site now has a road and car park, set some way below the ruins, and has become popular with visitors.\n\nThere are four main areas of the Takht Bahi complex:\n * The Stupa Court, a cluster of stupas located in a central courtyard.\n * The monastic chambers, consisting of individual cells arranged around a courtyard, assembly halls, and a dining area.\n * A temple complex, consisting of stupas and similar to the Stupa Court, but of later construction.\n * The Tantric monastic complex, which consists of small, dark cells with low openings, which may have been used for certain forms of Tantric meditation.\n\nAdditional structures on the site may have served as residences or meeting halls, or for secular purposes. All of the buildings on the site are constructed from local stone, and are mortared with lime and mud.\n\nArchaeologists have divided the history of the complex into four periods, beginning in the 1st century BCE.\n\nThe monastic complex was likely founded in the early 1st century CE. It is proven by an inscriptions found bearing the name of Gondophares (20-46 CE). After Gondophares, the place fell under control of Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan king. This first era continued until the 2nd century CE, and is associated with another Kushan king Kanishka, as well as early Parthian and later Kushan kings. The second construction period, which included the creation of the Stupa Court and assembly hall, took place during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. A third construction period, associated with the later Kushan dynasty and the Kidara Kushana rulers, occurred during the 4th and 5th centuries. The final construction period, which saw the creation of the so-called Tantric complex, took place in the 6th and 7th centuries CE, and was overseen by invading Hun rulers.\n\nDespite numerous invasions into the area, Takht-i-Bahi's hilltop location seems to have protected it from destruction, unlike many comparable early Buddhist monastic complexes. The complex was occupied continuously until Late Antiquity (7th century CE), when charitable funding for the site ended.\n\nThe first modern historical reference to these ruins was made in 1836 by the French Officer, the Buddhist remains are in a village named Mazdoorabad. Explorations and excavations on this site began in 1864. A significant number of objects from the site can be found in the British Museum. The site underwent a major restoration in the 1920s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe villages of Thordher (Old name Said Ghani Kalae), Ghafe, Lund Khwar, Sher Garh, Saroo Shah, Sehri-Bahlol, Pathai, Mazdoorabad, Fazl-e-abad, Gangai, Hathian, Jalala, Pirsaddi, Takkar and Mashal Khan Kalai are other historical places in the vicinity of Takht-Bhai. The most historical location in the era is Sehri Bahlol. This Buddhist monastery is situated on Malakand Road.\n\nThe word \"Sehri-Bahlol\" has been explained by various people in different ways. Local people claim that this is a Hindko word meaning \"Sir Bahlol\", a prominent political and religious leader of the area. However, the name is not as old as the village of Sehri-Bahlol.\n\nMeager economic conditions, poor educational facilities, and the nefarious effect of dealers of antiquities often result in severe hazard for the proper preservation of archaeological heritage in minor, less controlled sites.\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n * Ranigat (Another historic site in Buner)\n\n\n * Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol - UNESCO World Heritage List\n * UNESCO Periodic Report Summary - Includes a map of the complex.\n * Map of Gandhara archeological sites, from the Huntington Collection, Ohio State University (large file)",

      "title": "Nanga Parbat",
      "description": "Nanga Parbat (Urdu: ), locally known as Diamer, is the ninth highest mountain in the world at 8126 m above sea level. Located in the Diamer District of Pakistan’s Gilgit Baltistan region, Nanga Parbat is the western anchor of the Himalayas. The name Nanga Parbat is derived from the Sanskrit words nagna and parvata which together mean \"Naked Mountain\". The mountain is locally known by its Tibetan name Diamer or Deo Mir, meaning \"huge mountain\".\n\nNanga Parbat is one of the eight-thousanders. An immense, dramatic peak rising far above its surrounding terrain, Nanga Parbat is also a notoriously difficult climb. Numerous mountaineering deaths in the mid and early-20th century lent it the nickname \"Killer Mountain.”\n\nNanga Parbat forms the western anchor of the Himalayan Range and is the westernmost eight-thousander. It lies just south of the Indus River in the Diamer District of Gilgit–Baltistan in Pakistan. Not far to the north is the western end of the Karakoram range.\n\nNanga Parbat has tremendous vertical relief over local terrain in all directions.\n\nTo the south, Nanga Parbat has what is often referred to as the highest mountain face in the world: the Rupal Face rises 4600 m above its base. To the north, the complex, somewhat more gently sloped Rakhiot Flank rises 7000 m from the Indus River valley to the summit in just 25 km, one of the 10 greatest elevation gains in so short a distance on earth.\n\nNanga Parbat is one of only two peaks on earth that rank in the top twenty of both the highest mountains in the world, and the most prominent peaks in the world, ranking ninth and fourteenth respectively. The other is Mount Everest, which is first on both lists. It is also the second most prominent peak of the Himalayas, after Mount Everest. The key col for Nanga Parbat is Zoji La in Kashmir, which connects it to higher peaks in the remaining Himalaya-Karakoram range.\n\nOn the Tibetan Plateau Nanga Parbat is the western most peak of the Himalayas where as Namcha Barwa marks the east end.\n\n\n\nThe core of Nanga Parbat is a long ridge trending southwest–northeast. The ridge is an enormous bulk of ice and rock. It has three faces, Diamir face, Rakhiot, and Rupal. The southwestern portion of this main ridge is known as the Mazeno Wall, and has a number of subsidiary peaks. In the other direction, the main ridge arcs northeast at Rakhiot Peak . The south/southeast side of the mountain is dominated by the Rupal Face. The north/northwest side of the mountain, leading to the Indus, is more complex. It is split into the Diamir (west) face and the Rakhiot (north) face by a long ridge. There are a number of subsidiary summits, including North Peak some 3 km north of the main summit. Near the base of the Rupal Face is a glacial lake called Latbo, above a seasonal shepherds' village of the same name.\n\n\n\nBecause of its accessibility, attempts to summit Nanga Parbat began very soon after it was discovered by Europeans. In 1895 Albert F. Mummery led an expedition to the peak, and reached almost 6,100 m (20,000 ft) on the Diamir (West) Face, but Mummery and two Gurkha companions later died reconnoitering the Rakhiot Face.\n\nIn the 1930s, Nanga Parbat became the focus of German interest in the Himalayas. The German mountaineers were unable to attempt Mount Everest, as only the British had access to Tibet. Initially German efforts focused on Kanchenjunga, to which Paul Bauer led two expeditions in 1930 and 1931, but with its long ridges and steep faces Kanchenjunga was more difficult than Everest and neither expedition made much progress. K2 was known to be harder still, and its remoteness meant that even reaching its base would be a major undertaking. Nanga Parbat was therefore the highest mountain accessible to Germans and also deemed reasonably possible by climbers at the time.\n\nThe first German expedition to Nanga Parbat was led by Willy Merkl in 1932. It is sometimes referred to as a German-American expedition, as the eight climbers included Rand Herron, an American, and Fritz Wiessner, who would become an American citizen the following year. While the team were all strong climbers, none had Himalayan experience, and poor planning (particularly an inadequate number of porters), coupled with bad weather, prevented the team progressing far beyond the Rakhiot Peak northeast of the Nanga Parbat summit, reached by Peter Aschenbrenner and Herbert Kunigk, but they did establish the feasibility of a route via Rakhiot Peak and the main ridge.\n\nMerkl led another expedition in 1934, which was better prepared and financed with the full backing of the new Nazi government. Early in the expedition Alfred Drexel died, probably of high altitude pulmonary edema. The Tyrolean climbers Peter Aschenbrenner and Erwin Schneider reached an estimated height of on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7 they and 14 others were trapped by a storm at 7,480 m (24,540 ft). During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers, Uli Wieland, Willo Welzenbach and Merkl himself, and six Sherpas died of exhaustion, exposure and altitude sickness, and several more suffered severe frostbite. The last survivor to reach safety, Ang Tsering, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm. It has been said that the disaster, \"for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals.\"\n\nIn 1937, Karl Wien led another expedition to the mountain, following the same route as Merkl's expeditions had done. Progress was made, but more slowly than before due to heavy snowfall. About 14 June seven Germans and nine Sherpas, almost the entire team, were at Camp IV below Rakhiot Peak when it was overrun by an avalanche. All sixteen men died.\n\nThe Germans returned in 1938 led by Paul Bauer, but the expedition was plagued by bad weather, and Bauer, mindful of the previous disasters, ordered the party down before the Silver Saddle, halfway between Rakhiot Peak and Nanga Parbat summit, was reached.\n\nHeinrich Harrer, an expert alpinist, was a member of the SS Alpine unit. The unit practised on the Eiger mountain in Switzerland in 1938. When the group returned to Germany, Adolf Hitler met with them.\n\nIn May 1939, Harrer was selected by the German Himalayan Foundation to take part in a new expedition to the Nanga Parbat, under the leadership of Peter Aufschnaiter. Their goal was to scout new ways to make the ascent of the North-western face. They explored the Diamir Face with the aim of finding an easier route. They concluded that the face was a viable route, but the Second World War intervened and the four men were interned by the British in Dehradun, India. Harrer's escape and subsequent wanderings across the Tibetan Plateau became the subject of his book Seven Years in Tibet. Some evidence of this expedition is kept in the National Archives of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nNanga Parbat was first climbed, via the Rakhiot Flank (East Ridge), on July 3, 1953 by Austrian climber Hermann Buhl, a member of a German-Austrian team. The expedition was organized by the half-brother of Willy Merkl, Karl Herrligkoffer from Munich, while the expedition leader was Peter Aschenbrenner from Kufstein, who had participated in the 1932 and 1934 attempts. By the time of this expedition, 31 people had already died on the mountain.\n\nThe final push for the summit was dramatic: Buhl continued alone for the final 1300 m, after his companions had turned back. Under the influence of the drug pervitin (based on the stimulant methamphetamine used by soldiers during World War II), padutin, and tea from coca leaves, he reached the summit dangerously late, at 7:00 p.m., the climbing harder and more time-consuming than he had anticipated. His descent was slowed when he lost a crampon. Caught by darkness, he was forced to bivouac standing upright on a narrow ledge, holding a small handhold with one hand. Exhausted, he dozed occasionally, but managed to maintain his balance. He was also very fortunate to have a calm night, so he was not subjected to wind chill. He finally reached his high camp at 7:00 p.m. the next day, 40 hours after setting out. The ascent was made without oxygen, and Buhl is the only man to have made the first ascent of an 8000 m peak alone.\n\nThe 1953 documentary film Nanga Parbat 1953 was filmed and directed by Hans Ertl, who participated in the expedition.\n\nThe second ascent of Nanga Parbat was via the Diamir Face, in 1962, by Germans Toni Kinshofer, Siegfried Löw, and A. Mannhardt. The route is now the \"standard route\" on the mountain. The Kinshofer route does not ascend the middle of the Diamir Face, which is threatened by avalanches from massive hanging glaciers. Instead it climbs a buttress on the left side of the Diamir Face.\n\nIn 1970 the brothers Günther and Reinhold Messner made the third ascent of the mountain and the first ascent of the Rupal Face. They were unable to descend by their original route, and instead descended by the Diamir Face, making the first traverse of the mountain. Günther was killed in an avalanche on the Diamir Face. In 2005 Günther's remains were found on the Diamir Face.\n\nIn 1971 Ivan Fiala and Michael Orolin summited Nanga Parbat via Buhl's 1953 route while other expedition members climbed the southeast peak (7600 m) above the Silbersattel and the foresummit (7850 m) above the Bazhin Gap.\n\nIn 1976 a team of four made the sixth summit via a new route on the Rupal Face (second ascent on this face), then named the Schell route after the Austrian team leader. The line had been plotted by Karl Herrligkoffer on a previous unsuccessful attempt.\n\nIn 1978 Reinhold Messner returned to the Diamir Face and achieved the first completely solo ascent (i.e., always solo above base camp) of an 8000 m peak.\n\nIn 1984 the French climber Lilliane Barrard became the first woman to climb Nanga Parbat, along with her husband Maurice Barrard.\n\nIn 1985, Jerzy Kukuczka, Zygmunt Heinrich, Slawomir Lobodzinski (all Polish), and Carlos Carsolio (Mexico) climbed up the Southeast Pillar (or Polish Spur) on the right-hand side of the Rupal Face, reaching the summit July 13. It was Kukuczka's ninth 8000 m summit.\n\nAlso in 1985, a Polish women's team climbed the peak via the 1962 German Diamir Face route. Wanda Rutkiewicz, Krystyna Palmowska, and Anna Czerwinska reached the summit on July 15.\n\n\"Modern\" superalpinism was brought to Nanga Parbat in 1988 with an unsuccessful attempt or two on the Rupal Face by Barry Blanchard, Mark Twight, Ward Robinson, and Kevin Doyle.\n\n2005 saw a resurgence of lightweight, alpine-style attempts on the Rupal Face:\n\n* In August 2005, Pakistani military helicopters rescued Slovenian mountaineer Tomaž Humar, who was stuck under a narrow ice ledge at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) for six days. It is believed to be one of the few successful rescues carried out at such high altitude.\n\n* In September 2005, Vince Anderson and Steve House did an extremely lightweight, fast ascent of a new, direct route on the face, earning high praise from the climbing community.\n\n* On July 17 or 18, 2006, José Antonio Delgado from Venezuela died a few days after reaching the summit, where he was caught by bad weather for six days and was unable to make his way down. He is the only Venezuelan climber, and one of few Latin Americans, to have reached the summit of five eight-thousanders. Part of the expedition and the rescue efforts at base camp were captured on video, as Delgado was the subject of a pilot for a mountaineering television series. Explorart Films, the production company, later developed the project into a feature documentary film called Beyond the Summit, which was scheduled to be released in South America in January 2008.\n\n* On July 15, 2008, Italian alpinist Karl Unterkircher fell into a crevasse during an attempt to open a new route to the top with Walter Nones and Simon Kehrer. Unterkircher died, but Kehrer and Nones were rescued by the Pakistani Army.\n\n* On July 12, 2009, after reaching the summit, South Korean climber Go Mi-Young fell off a cliff on the descent in bad weather in her race to be the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.\n\n* On July 15, 2012 Scottish mountaineers Sandy Allan and Rick Allen made the first ascent of Nanga Parbat via the 10 km Mazeno Ridge, and in April 2013 were awarded the Piolet d'Or for their achievement.\n\nNanga Parbat was first successfully climbed in winter on February 26, 2016, by a team consisting of Ali Sadpara, Alex Txikon, and Simone Moro.\n\nThe second winter ascent was made by Pole Tomasz Mackiewicz and Frenchwoman Elisabeth Revol on January 25, 2018.\n\nPrevious attempts:\n * 1988/89 – Polish 12-member expedition KW Zakopane under the leadership of Maciej Berbeka. They first attempted the Rupal Face and then the Diamir Face. On the Messner route, Maciej Berbeka, Piotr Konopka, and Andrzej Osika reached an elevation of about 6500-6800 m.\n * 1990/91 – Polish-English expedition under the leadership of Maciej Berbeka reached the height of 6600m on the Messner route, and then Andrzej Osika and John Tinker by the Schell route up the Rupal Face reached a height of 6600 m.\n * 1991/92 – Polish expedition KW Zakopane under the leadership of Maciej Berbeka from the Rupal valley. This attack in alpine style on the Schell route reached the height of 7000 m.\n * 1992/93 – French expedition Eric Monier and Monique Loscos – Schell route on the Rupal Face. They came to BC on December 20. Eric reached 6500 m on January 9 and on January 13 the expedition was abandoned.\n * 1996/97 – two expeditions:\n * Polish expedition led by Andrzej Zawada from the Diamir valley, Kinshofer route. During the summit attempt by the team of Zbigniew Trzmiel and Krzysztof Pankiewicz, Trzmiel reached a height of 7800 m. The assault was interrupted because of frostbite.

Another foreign victim was injured. The attack occurred at around 1 am and was claimed by a local branch of the Taliban. (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan).\n\nIn the first chapter of Mistress of Mistresses, by E.R. Eddison, the narrator compares his now deceased compatriot, Lessingham, to Nanga Parbat in a descriptive passage: :\"I remember, years later, his describing to me the effect of the sudden view you get of Nanga Parbat from one of those Kashmir valleys; you have been riding for hours among quiet richly wooded scenery, winding up along the side of some kind of gorge, with nothing very big to look at, just lush, leafy, pussy-cat country of steep hillsides and waterfalls; then suddenly you come round a corner where the view opens up the valley, and you are almost struck senseless by the blinding splendour of that vast face of ice-hung precipices and soaring ridges, sixteen thousand feet from top to toe, filling a whole quarter of the heavens at a distance of, I suppose, only a dozen miles. And now, whenever I call to mind my first sight of Lessingham in that little daleside church so many years ago, I think of Nanga Parbat.\" (Mistress of Mistresses, 1935, p.2-3)\n\nJonathan Neale wrote a book about the 1934 climbing season on Nanga Parbat called Tigers of the Snow. He interviewed many old Sherpas, including Ang Tsering, the last man off Nanga Parbat alive in 1934. The book attempts to narrate what went wrong on the expedition, set against mountaineering history of the early twentieth century, the background of German politics in the 1930s, and the hardship and passion of life in the Sherpa valleys.\n\nNanda Parbat, a fictional city in the DC Universe, is named after the mountain.\n\nNanga Parbat is a movie by Joseph Vilsmaier about the 1970 expedition of brothers Günther Messner and Reinhold Messner.

      "title": "Broad Peak",
      "description": "Broad Peak (undefined) is the 12th highest mountain in the world at 8047 m above sea level. The literal translation of \"Broad Peak\" to Falchan Kangri is not used among the Balti people. The English name was introduced in 1892 by the British explorer Martin Conway, in reference to the similarly named Breithorn in the Alps.\n\nBroad Peak is part of the Gasherbrum massif in Baltistan on the border of Pakistan and China. It is located in the Karakoram mountain range about 8 km from K2. It has a summit over 1.5 km long, thus \"Broad Peak\".\n\nThe mountain has several summits: Broad Peak (8051 m), Rocky Summit (8028 m), Broad Peak Central (8011 m), Broad Peak North (7490 m), and Kharut Kangri (6942 m).\n\nThe first ascent of Broad Peak was made between June 8 and 9, 1957 by Fritz Wintersteller, Marcus Schmuck, Kurt Diemberger, and Hermann Buhl of an Austrian expedition led by Marcus Schmuck. A first attempt by the team was made on May 29 where Fritz Wintersteller and Kurt Diemberger reached the forepeak (8,030 m). This was also accomplished without the aid of supplemental oxygen, high altitude porters or base camp support.\n\nOn the same expedition, Marcus Schmuck and Fritz Wintersteller made a flash first ascent of Skil Brum peak (7,360 m) on June 19, 1957 in pure Alpine style in 53 hours.\n\nHermann Buhl fell to his death when he and Diemberger attempted to climb nearby Chogolisa (7,654 m) on June 27, 1957.\n\nIn July 2007 an Austrian mountaineering team climbed Broad Peak and retrieved the corpse of Markus Kronthaler, who had died on the mountain one year before, from over 8,000 metres.\n\nIn the winter and summer of 2009 there were no summits. There was one winter expedition by a Polish-Canadian team. In the summer there was one fatality, Cristina Castagna.\n\nIn summer 2012, five members of \"Koroška 8000\" - Slovenian team (led by Gregor Lačen) summitted the mountain (without supplementary oxygen and without high altitude porters). They tracked the way in deep snow from Camp 4 to the summit and opened the summit to seven more climbers from other expeditions. They all summitted on July 31, 2012.\n\nOn March 5, 2013 Maciej Berbeka, Adam Bielecki, Tomasz Kowalski and Artur Małek made the first winter ascent. Broad Peak was the twelfth Eight-thousander summited in winter time and the tenth Eight-thousander first summitted in winter by Polish climbers. During the descent, Maciej Berbeka and Tomasz Kowalski did not reach Camp 4 (at 7400 m) and were pronounced missing. On March 7, the head of the expedition Krzysztof Wielicki, said there are \"no chances at all\" of finding alive 58-year-old Maciej Berbeka and 27-year-old Tomasz Kowalski. On March 8 both climbers were declared dead and the expedition was ended.\n\nIn July 2013, a group of five Iranian climbers attempted to ascend through a new route from the southwestern face. Three of them — Aidin Bozorgi, Pouya Keivan, and Mojtaba Jarahi — ascended successfully but during descent all three of them were lost and declared dead.\n\nOn July 23, 2016, Frenchman Antoine Girard's paraglider flight over Broad Peak was the first time a paraglider had flown above an 8,000-metre summit.\n\n\n * 1954 First attempt by Dr. Karl Herligkoffer of Germany on the SW side that failed due to a storm and extreme cold.\n * 1957 First ascent by an Austrian expedition.\n * 1983 First ascent by a woman, Krystyna Palmowska.\n * 1984 First one-day ascent of an 8000-meter peak (solo) by Krzysztof Wielicki in 21.5 hours.\n * 1994 On July 9, Carlos Carsolio reached the summit, establishing a new solo route now known as Route Carsolio.\n * 1997 On July 7, Anatoli Boukreev achieved a solo ascent.\n * 2013 On March 5, first winter ascent by Polish expedition.\n * 2013 July, Aidin Bozorgi, Pouya Keivan, and Mojtaba Jarahi of Iran ascended through a new route, named Route Iran.\n * 2014 Hunza Expedition to Broad Peak made the summit on 23 July 2014, Karim Hayat reached to main summit and Naseer Uddin turned back from Rocky summit.

      "description": "Rakaposhi (undefined) is a mountain in the Karakoram mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. It is situated in the middle of the Nagar and Bagrote valleys and danyor, approximately 100 km north of the capital city Gilgit of the semi-autonomous Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. Rakaposhi means \"snow covered\" in the local language. Rakaposhi is also known as Dumani (\"Mother of Mist\" or \"Mother of Clouds\"). It is ranked 27th highest in the world.\n\nThe first successful recorded ascent by non-natives was in 1958 by Mike Banks and Tom Patey, members of a British-Pakistani expedition, via the Southwest Spur/Ridge route. Both of them suffered minor frostbite during the ascent to the summit on June 25. Another climber slipped and fell on the descent and died during the night.\n\nThe people of Nagar have dedicated the Rakaposhi range mountain area as a community park. The Minister for Northern Areas inaugurated the park. The Rakaposhi mountain range is the home of endangered species such as Marco Polo sheep, snow leopard, brown bear, and wolves.\n\nRakaposhi is notable for its exceptional rise over local terrain. On the north, it rises 5900 m in only an 11.2 km (7 mi) horizontal distance from the Hunza-Nagar River. There are views of Rakaposhi from the Karakoram Highway on the route through Nagar. A tourist spot in the town of Ghulmat (located in the Nagar Valley) called \"Zero Point of Rakaposhi\" is the closest view point of the mountain. Rakaposhi is the only mountain in the world which rises straight from beautifully cultivated fields to the height of 25,550 feet. From many places this wonderful spectacle can be viewed right from the base to the top.\n\n\n\n\n * 1892 Martin Conway explores the south side of Rakaposhi.\n * 1938 M. Vyvyan and R. Campbell Secord make the first reconnaissance and climb a north-western forepeak (about 5800 m) via the northwest ridge.\n * 1947 Secord returns with H. W. Tilman and two Swiss climbers, Hans Gyr and Robert Kappeler; they ascend via the Gunti glacier to 5,800 m (19,000 ft) on the south-west spur.\n * 1954 Cambridge University team, led by Alfred Tissières, attempts the peak via the south-west spur but only reached 6,340 m (20,800 ft). Also, an Austro-German expedition led by Mathias Rebitsch attempted the same route.\n * 1956 A British-American expedition, led by Mike Banks, reaches 7,163 m (23,500 ft) on the Southwest Ridge, above the Gunti glacier.\n * 1958 The first ascent, noted above.\n * 1964 An Irish expedition attempts the long and difficult Northwest Ridge.\n * 1971 Karl Herrligkofer leads an attempt on the elegant but difficult North Spur (or North Ridge).\n * 1973 Herrligkofer returns to the North Spur but is again unsuccessful due to time and weather problems.\n * 1979 A Polish-Pakistani expedition ascends the Northwest Ridge from the Biro Glacier.\n * 1979 A Japanese expedition from Waseda University, led by Eiho Ohtani, succeeds in climbing the North Spur. Summit party: Ohtani and Matsushi Yamashita. This ascent was expedition-style, done over a period of six weeks, with 5000 m of fixed rope.\n * 1984 A Canadian team achieves a semi-alpine-style ascent of the North Spur, using much less fixed rope than the Japanese team had.

      "title": "Astola Island",
      "description": "Astola Island, also known as Jezira Haft Talar (Balochi: زروان ءِ هفت تلار) Satadip or 'Island of the Seven Hills', is a small uninhabited Pakistani island in the Arabian Sea approximately 25 km south of the nearest part of the coast and 39 km southeast of the fishing port of Pasni. Astola is Pakistan's largest offshore island at approximately 6.7 km long with a maximum width of 2.3 km and an area of approximately 6.7 km2. The highest point is 246 ft above sea level. Administratively, the island is part of the Pasni subdistrict of Gwadar District in Balochistan province. The island can be accessed by motorized boats from Pasni, with a journey time of about 5 hours to reach the island.\n\nPakistan declared Astola as its first Marine Protected Area in June 2017 as part an international obligation of the Federal Government under the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi Biodiversity.\n\nThe earliest mention of Astola is in Arrian's account of Admiral Nearchos, who was dispatched by Alexander the Great to explore the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf in 325 BCE. The sailors in Nearchos's fleet were \"frightened at the weird tales told about an uninhabited island, which Arrian calls Nosala\".\n\nThe island consists of a large tilted plateau and a series of seven small hillocks (hence the local name \"Haft Talar\" or \"Seven Hills\"), with deep chasms and crevices, which are several feet wide. There are several natural caves and coves on the island. The south face of the island slopes off gradually whereas the north face is cliff-like with a sharp vertical drop.\n\nIsolation has helped maintain several endemic life forms on Astola. The endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbracata) nest on the beach at the foot of the cliffs. The island is also an important area for endemic reptiles such as the Astola viper (Echis carinatus astolae). The island is reported to support a large number of breeding water birds including coursers, curlews, godwit, gulls, plovers and sanderling. Feral cats originally introduced by fishermen to control the endemic rodent population, pose an increasing threat to wildlife breeding sites. E.g. the sooty gull (Larus hemprichii) had a major breeding colony on the island, now extirpated because of introduced rats.\n\nVegetation on the island is sparse and largely consists of scrubs and large bushes. There are no trees on the island. The largest shrub on the island is Prosopis juliflora, which was introduced into South Asia in 1877 from South America. There is no source of fresh water on the island and the vegetation depends on occasional rainfall and soil moisture for survival. Astola is also home to coral reef.\n\nIn 1982, the Government of Pakistan installed a lighthouse on the island for the safety of passing vessels, which was replaced by a solar-powered one in 1987.\n\nBetween September and May of each year, Astola becomes a temporary base for mainland fishermen for catching lobsters and oysters. From June to August, the island remains uninhabited due to the fishing off-season, the rough seas and high tides.\n\nThere is a small mosque dedicated to the Muslim saint Pir Khawaja Khizr, which is used by the mainland fishermen during the fishing season. Ruins of an ancient Hindu temple of the Hindu goddess, Kali are located on the island. The island was also known to the Hindus as Satadip.\n\nIn Arrian's Indica, which describes the westward journey of Alexander's fleet after the Indian Campaign (325 BC), Admiral Nearchus is quoted as having anchored by an island named 'Carnine'. It was said to be inhabited by the Ichthyophagoi ('fish eaters' in Greek) and where, \"even mutton had a fishy taste\". The Persian phrase mahi khoran (fish eaters) has become the modern name of the coastal region of Makran. Some scholars have assumed Carnine to be Astola, without considering the extreme aridity and lack of fresh water, which renders the place inhospitable for human habitation, as well as animal husbandry. In all likelihood, Carnine was the name of an island in the inland sea, presently known as Khor Kalmat. This latter conjecture supports Nearchus' coast-hugging voyage (which would have kept him well away from Astola), a compulsion meant to provision Alexander's army that was supposed to have marched along a coastal route.\n\n\n * List of lighthouses in Pakistan\n * List of islands of Pakistan\n\n\n * Astola Island – A Spellbinding Site\n * \n * ",

      "title": "Bolan Pass",
      "description": "The Bolān Pass (undefined) is a mountain pass through the Toba Kakar Range of Balochistan province in western Pakistan, 120 km from the Afghanistan border. The pass is an 89 km stretch of the Bolan river valley from Rindli in the south to Darwāza near Kolpur in the north. It is made up of a number of narrow gorges and stretches. It connects Sibi with Quetta both by road and railway.\n\nStrategically located, traders, invaders, and nomadic tribes have also used it as a gateway to and from South Asia. The Bolān Pass is an important pass on the Baluch frontier, connecting Jacobabad and Sibi with Quetta, which has always occupied an important place in the history of British campaigns in Afghanistan.\n\nThe local population predominantly consists of Brahvi tribes, who extend from Bolan Pass to Cape Monze on the Arabian Sea.\n\nA British officer of the Bengal Artillery described the Bolan Pass in 1841 in the words: \"The road through this pass leads, with few and rare exceptions, along what is the bed of a mountain-torrent, when filled by the melting of the snows or heavy rains, and is composed of loose shingly gravel, that recedes from under your feet, and is very difficult for draught: camels get on well. It is infested by the Kakurs, who live by robbery; and the hills sometimes close in upon the road, which is filled up by the bed of the stream, running through rocky chasms, upwards of a hundred feet high, from the top of which the robbers assail the travellers with stones; and were they as bold as they are cruel and perfidious, they might hold the place against all comers. Many spots were pointed out to me by the guides I had with me, as signalised by acts of violence, several European officers having lost their baggage during our occupation of the country. Should there be rain in the higher parts of the mountains, the stream at times comes down in an almost perpendicular volume, without warning, and sweeping all before it, as a friend of mine experienced, when he saw a party of men, horses, and camels, and all his property, borne down by it; when himself and some few men with him escaped by climbing up the nearly perpendicular side of the hill. About thirty-seven men were washed away upon that occasion.\"\n\n\n\nIn 1837, threatened by a possible Russian invasion of South Asia via the Khyber and Bolān Passes, a British envoy was sent to Kabul to gain support of the Emir, Dost Mohammed. In February 1839, the British Army under Sir John Keane took 12,000 men through the Bolān Pass and entered Kandahar, which the Afghan Princes had abandoned; from there they would go on to attack and overthrow Ghazni.\n\nIn 1883, Sir Robert Groves Sandeman negotiated with the Khan of Kalat, Khudadad Khan, and secured British control over the pass in exchange for an annual fee.\n\nFrom Sibi the line runs south-west, skirting the hills to Rindli, and originally followed the course of the Bolān stream to its head on the plateau. The destructive action of floods, however, led to the abandonment of this alignment, and the railway now follows the Mashkaf valley (which debouches into the plains close to Sibi), and is carried from near the head of the Mashkaf to a junction with the Bolān at Machh. An alternative route from Sibi to Quetta was found in the Harnai valley to the N.E. of Sibi, the line starting in exactly the opposite direction to that of the Bolān and entering the hills at Nari. The Harnai route, although longer, is the one adopted for all ordinary traffic, the Bolān loop being reserved for emergencies. At the Khundilani gorge of the Bolān route conglomerate cliffs, which rise to a height of 800 ft., enclose the valley. At Siri Bolān the passage between the limestone rocks hardly admits of three persons riding abreast. The temperature of the pass in summer is very high, whereas in winter, near its head, the cold is extreme, and the ice-cold wind rushing down the narrow outlet becomes destructive to life. Since 1877, when the Quetta agency was founded, the pass was secured by the British Indian Army from militias of Baluch tribesmen (chiefly Marris).\n\n\n * Balochistan\n * Mehrgarh\n\n",

It passes the towns of Ormara and Pasni.\n\nPrior to the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway in 2004, the port city of Karachi was linked to the port town of Gwadar via an uncarpeted \"jeep\" or \"dirt\" track. The journey between Karachi and Gwadar used to take at least two days and took a heavy toll on the \"wear and tear\" of vehicles. It was considered preferable to take the safer but longer route via Quetta.\n\nAfter completion of the Makran Coastal Highway, the average journey time between Karachi and Gwadar has been reduced to only 6 to 7 hours and transportation costs have also been reduced.\n\nThe Makran Coastal Highway was planned and built by the Government of Pakistan with the following objectives:\n\n\n * To develop infrastructure and boost economic activity in the areas along Pakistan's coastline\n * To improve the transportation and communications infrastructure in Balochistan province\n * To develop the coastal towns of Ormara, Pasni and Gwadar into major port cities\n * To link Ormara, Pasni and Gwadar with the rest of Pakistan's national highways network\n * To develop the seafood industry along Pakistan's coastline by reducing the time and costs involved in transporting fresh seafood from seafood catchment areas to major cities in Pakistan as well as export processing zones in Karachi and Gwadar\n\nThe construction contract for the Makran Coastal Highway was awarded to Pakistan's Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), which built the Karakorum Highway.\n\nConstruction work on the Makran Coastal Highway Project commenced in 2002 and was completed by 14 December 2004, in a period of three years.\n\nThe Makran Coastal Highway is managed and maintained by Pakistan's National Highway Authority.\n\n\n\n\n * National Highways of Pakistan\n * Motorways of Pakistan\n * Transport in Pakistan\n\n\n * National Highway Authority\n * Frontier Works Organization",

      "title": "Gwadar",
      "description": "Gwadar (Balochi and undefined; ; غوادر) is a port city on the southwestern coast of Balochistan, Pakistan. The city is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea opposite Oman. Gwadar was an overseas possession of Oman from 1783 to 1958. It is about 120 km southwest of Turbat, while the sister port city of Chabahar in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province is about 170 km to the west of Gwadar.\n\nFor most of its history, Gwadar was a small to medium-sized settlement with an economy largely based on artisanal fishing. The strategic value of its location was first recognized in 1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep water port by the United States Geological Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still under Omani rule. The area's potential to be a major deep water port remained untapped under successive Pakistani governments until 2001, when construction on the first phase of Gwadar Port was initiated. The first phase was inaugurated by General Parvez Musharraf in 2007 at a total cost of $248 million. The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons, including lack of investment, security concerns, and the Government of Pakistan's failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator, Port of Singapore Authority.\n\nIn April 2015, Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the $46 billion China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which in turn forms part of China's ambitious One Belt, One Road. Gwadar features heavily in CPEC, and is also envisaged to be the link between the One Belt, One Road and Maritime Silk Road project. $1.153 billion worth of infrastructure projects will be invested into the city as part of CPEC, with the aim of linking northern Pakistan and western China to the deep water seaport. The city will also be the site of a floating liquefied natural gas facility that will be built as part of the larger $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline project. In addition to investments directly under the aegis of CPEC in Gwadar city, the China Overseas Port Holding Company in June 2016 began construction on the $2 billion Gwadar Special Economic Zone, which is being modelled on the lines of the Special Economic Zones of China. In September 2016 the Gwadar Development Authority published a request for tenders for the preparation of expropriation and resettlement of Old Town Gwadar.\n\nThe word \"Gwadar\" is a combination of two Balochi words – Guad meaning Wind and Dar meaning Gateway or door, thus Gwadar means \"The Gate of wind\".\n\n\n\nThe inhabitation of Gwadar, like most areas of Balochistan, appears to be ancient. The area shows inhabitation as early as the bronze age with settlements around some of the area's oasis. It is from this settlement pattern that word Makran, the original name of Balochistan, is derived. For a period, it was a region of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. It is believed to have been conquered by the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great. The capital of the satrapy of Gedrosia was Pura, which is thought to have been located near the modern Bampūr, in Iranian Balochistan. During the homeward march of Alexander the Great, his admiral, Nearchus, led a fleet along the modern-day Makran coast and recorded that the area was dry, mountainous, and inhabited by the \"Ichthyophagoi\" (or \"fish eaters\"), an ancient Greek rendering of the ancient Persian phrase \"Mahi khoran,\" which has itself become the modern word \"Makran\". After the collapse of Alexander's empire the area was ruled by Seleucus Nicator, one of Alexander's generals. The region then came under Mauryan rule around 303 BCE, after Seleucus made peace with Emperor Chandragupta and ceded the territory to the Mauryans.\n\nThe region remained on the sidelines of history for a millennium until the Arab-Muslim army of Umar captured Makran in AD 643 and over the intervening (and nearly equivalent) amount of time the area was contested by various powers. This was then followed by almost two centuries of local rule by the various Baloch tribes. The city was visited by Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis in the 1550s and mentioned in his book Mirat ul Memalik (The Mirror of Countries), 1557. According to Seydi Ali Reis, the inhabitants of Gwadar were Baloch and their chief was Malik Jelaleddin, son of Malik Dinar.\n\nIn the 15th century the Portuguese conquered parts of India and Oman. They planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of Makran. They attacked Gwadar under the leadership of Vasco de Gama, but under the supervision of Commander Mir Ismaheel Baloch, the Portuguese were defeated by the Baloch. A few times the Portuguese looted and set the coastal villages on fire, but they failed to capture Gwadar. Cannons of the Portuguese army were found lying near the Central Jail of Gwadar, heirless. The grave of Mir Ismaheel Baloch is situated near the Mountain of Batal Gwadar, constructed by Mir Ismaheel Baloch himself during life. He died in 873 Hijri. By the end of the 16th century, Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great conquered the city along with all of Balochistan after the Battle of Sehwan. It remained under Mughal control until early 18th century.\n\nIn 1783, the Khan of Kalat Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch granted suzerainty over Gwadar to Taimur Sultan, the defeated ruler of Muscat. When the sultan subsequently retook Muscat, he was to continue his rule in Gwadar by appointing a wali (or \"governor\"). This wali was then ordered to subjugate the nearby coastal town of Chabahar (now in Iran). The Gwadar fort was built during Omani rule, whilst telegraph lines were later extended into the town courtesy of the British. In the middle of the 18th century, Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch captured Gwadar and its surrounding areas after defeating the Gichki Baloch tribe and included it in the Kalat Khanate. However, realizing that maintaining control of the area will be difficult without the support of the Gichkis, Mir Nasir entered into an agreement with the local Gichki Chief, which allowed the Gichkis to maintain administrative control of the area, in return for furnishing half the collected revenues to Kalat, this arrangement continued till 1783. When Saiad Sultan fell out with his brother, the ruler of Muscat, and asked for help, Mir Noori Naseer Khan handed over Gwadar, as part of his share of revenues, to Saiad Sultan for his maintenance with the understanding that the area be returned to Kalat, when Saiad Sultan acquires the throne. Saiad Sultan ascended to the throne of Muscat in 1797 but never returned Gwadar enclave to Kalat. The ensuing struggle between the heirs of the Sultan and Khan of Kalat for possession of Gwadar, allowed the British to intervene. The British after extracting concessions from the Sultan for the use of the area facilitated Muscat to retain Gwadar. Later on, the British claimed that the area was granted to the Sultan by Mir Nasir, however, local accounts and the declassified documents of that time challenge this claim. From 1863 to 1879 Gwadar was the headquarters of a British Assistant Political Agent. Gwadar was a fortnightly port of call for the British India Steamship Navigation Company's steamers and included a combined Post & Telegraph Office. Sultan was the sovereign of Gwadar until negotiations were held with the government of Pakistan in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1948, Makran acceded to Pakistan and was made a district – Gwadar then, was not included in Makran. In 1958, Gwadar and its surrounding areas were reverted by Muscat to Pakistan. It was given the status of a Tahsil of Makran district. It was Feroz Khan Noon's regime when accession of Gwadar took place and it is propagated that Akbar Bugti, as minister of state for defence, was part of negotiations. On 1 July 1977, Makran District was upgraded into a division and was divided into three districts of Turbat (Kech since 1994–95), Panjgur and Gwadar.\n\nOn 8 September 1958, Pakistan purchased the Gwadar enclave from Oman for 5.5 billion Rupees (equivalent to US$1.1 billion in 2015 dollars). The Agreement had two important clauses: (1) All Balochistan would form a military recruitment source for Oman; as a result, Balochis constitute a major part of Omani forces, and (2) the resources of Gwadar would be further developed. Most of the money for the purchase came from donations, with Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan IV, the greatest contributor, while the remainder was paid through tax revenue. At the time, Gwadar was a small and underdeveloped fishing village with a population of a few thousand. The Pakistani government integrated Gwadar into Balochistan province on 1 July 1977 as the district headquarters of the newly formed Gwadar District. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan formally conceived the plan to develop Gwadar into a major port city with a deep-sea port and to connect it with Pakistan's highway and rail networks. On 22 March 2002, the Government of Pakistan began construction of Gwadar Port, a modern deep-sea port, Phase I of which was completed in March 2007. Gwadar Port was inaugurated on 20 March 2007.\n\nGwadar underwent major development from 2002 to 2007. In 2002, Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) began construction of the 653 km-long Makran Coastal Highway linking Gwadar with Karachi via Pasni and Ormara and onwards with the rest of the National Highways of Pakistan, which was completed in 2004. In 2003, the Gwadar Development Authority was established to oversee the planning and development of Gwadar and Gwadar Industrial Estate Development Authority was established to promote industrial activities in mega port city of Gwadar. In 2004, Pakistan's NHA began construction of the 820-km long M8 motorway linking Gwadar with Ratodero in Sindh province via Turbat, Hoshab, Awaran and Khuzdar and onwards with the rest of the Motorways of Pakistan. In 2006, the Gwadar Development Authority conceived, developed and adopted a 50-year Master Plan for Gwadar. In 2007, the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan acquired 4,300 acre to construct a new greenfield airport, the New Gwadar International Airport 6,000 acre, at an estimated cost of US$246 million.\n\n\n\nGwadar is situated on the southwestern Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan in Gwadar District of Balochistan province. Like Ormara further east, Gwadar is situated on a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula forming two almost perfect, but naturally curved, semicircular bays on either side. The city is situated on a narrow and sandy 12 kilometers long isthmus which connects the Pakistani coast to rocky outcroppings in the Arabian sea known as the Gwadar Promontory, or Koh-e-Batil, which reach an altitude of 480 feet and extends seven miles east to west with a breadth of one mile. The 800 foot wide isthmus upon which Gwadar is located separates the two almost perfect semicircular bays from one another. The western bay is known as the Paddi Zirr, and is generally shallow with an average depth of 12 feet, and a maximum depth of 30 feet. To the east of the isthmus is the deepwater Demi Zirr harbor, where the Gwadar Port was built.\n\nThe area north of the city and Gwadar Promentory is flate and generally barren. The white clay Koh-e-Mehdi (also known as Jabal-e-Mehdi) is a notable exception, and rises sharply from the plans to the northeast of Gwadar. The Koh-e-Mehdi features a two discernible peaks, with a height of 1,360 and 1,375 feet, and is approximately 4 miles wide and features sharp cliffs that drop precipitously into the Arabian Sea. Following an earthquake in September 2013 a small island called Zalzala Jazeera (\"Earthquake Island\") formed approximately 2 km off the coast.\n\nThe population of the city has risen to approximately 85,000 as of 2014. The population of Gwadar is predominantly Baloch.\n\nGwadar has a hot desert climate (Köppen BWh), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Oceanic influence from the cool currents of the Arabian Sea moderates temperatures, resulting in notably cooler summer temperatures compared to areas inland and cities in the Persian Gulf such as Dubai. The Arabian Sea also moderates winter temperatures, resulting in warmer winter nights as compared to inland areas.\n\nThe mean temperature in the hottest month (June) remains between 31 °C and 32 °C. The mean temperature in the coolest month (January) varies from 18 °C to 19 °C. The uniformity of temperature is a unique characteristic of the Makran Coastal region. Occasionally, winds moving down the Balochistan plateau bring brief cold spells, otherwise the winter is pleasant. In Gwadar, winters are shorter than summers. Although Gwadar is situated outside the monsoon belt, it receives light monsoon showers in summer (June–August). However, in winter, Western Disturbance can cause heavy rainfall. Annual rainfall is only 100 mm (3 inches). In June 2010, Gwadar was lashed by Cyclone Phet with record-breaking rains of 372 mm and winds up to 75 mph.\n\nGwadar serves the headquarters for both Gwadar District and Gwadar Tehsil. Gwadar Tehsil is administratively subdivided into five union councils.\n\nGwadar is divided into 5 union councils, which are further subdivided into wards:\n\n\n * Gwadar Central\n * Gazrawan\n * Komagri\n * Mohallah Zahoor Shah\n * Sohrabi\n * Saleh Muhammad\n * Usmania\n * South Gwadar\n * Kamari\n * Mohallah Karim Bakhsh\n * Mohallah Shahdu Band\n * Mullah Band\n * Murad Bakhsh\n * Sarabi\n * Sheikh Umar\n * Tobagh\n * North Gwadar\n * Lal Baksh\n * Mohalla Baloch\n * Mohalla Mir Abdul Ghafoor\n * Mujahid\n * Pishukan\n * Sorbandar\n\nGwadar's location and history have given it a unique blend of cultures. The Arabic influence upon Gwadar is strong as a consequence of the Omani era and its close proximity to the Arabian peninsula. The legacy of the Omanis is observed in some of the local population who can trace their lineage to Afro-Arabs and Zanj slaves, who settled in the town during Omani rule. Remnants of Oman era buildings can also be found in the city.\n\nThe port of Gwadar can provide China a Listening Post to Observe the Indian naval activities around the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden. Central Asia and South Asia, encompassing the Caspian Region, Central Asian republics, Afghanistan and Iran, and the energy-rich ‘lake’ called the Caspian Sea, is a significant region because of its huge monetary prospective and geographically vital positioning, which has formed the region as a centre piece in the international arena. Iran has also declared support for the development of Gwadar and its port.\n\nGwadar's economy has, in the past, been dependent mostly on fishing. Its economy, however, is undergoing rapid transformation as a small fishing village is being transformed into a major port city of Pakistan with improved communication links with the rest of Pakistan. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan commenced a feasibility study for the construction of a deep-sea port at Gwadar. On 22 March 2002, the Government of Pakistan began construction of Gwadar Port, a modern deep-sea port, the first phase of which was completed in December 2005 and the second in March 2007. Gwadar Port became fully operational in December 2009. The 1400 km Trans-Afghan Gas Pipeline (TAP) from Turkmenistan to Gwadar (Pakistan), a long-dormant project that would pump Turkmen natural gas to markets in South Asia, may finally be poised to begin at a cost of $3 billion.\n\nThe construction on a $2 billion 10-square kilometre tax exempt industrial zone began on 20 June 2016. The zone includes a 300MW plant exclusive for the industrial zone.\n\nChina has a great strategic interest in Gwadar. In 2013, the state-owned China Overseas Port Holdings Limited acquired Gwadar Port. The port is strategically important for China as sixty percent of China's oil comes from the Persian Gulf by ships traveling over 16,000 kilometres in two to three months, confronting pirates, bad weather, political rivals, and other risks up to its only commercial port, Shanghai. Gwadar will reduce the distance to a mere 5000 kilometres and also serve round the year.\n\nChina has been instrumental in the design of the project. China is providing approximately 80% of the cost of the port in the shape of grants and soft loans. Over 500 Chinese workers have worked on the project on a 24-hour basis to complete the port setup. There are still a large number of Chinese workers and engineers working on the project. China is setting up a dry port at the Pakistan–China border to take advantage of a shorter route to sea through Gwadar. China paid US$360 million to Pakistan for expansion and an upgrade for all weather trafficability of Karakoram Highway linking Pakistan with China. The contract has been awarded to Frontier Works Organization, who has also started the project. Feasibility and engineering studies to connect China with Gwadar through a pipeline and railway track have already begun.\n\nChina is heavily dependent on Persian Gulf oil which passes through the Strait of Malacca all the way through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Once the oil reaches China's east coast ports, it is transported thousands of miles inland to western China. The Gwadar port-Karakoram Highway (KKH) route is sometimes said to be safer, cheaper and shorter than transporting the oil by ocean tanker. However, research suggests that transporting oil by roadways from Gwadar to China would be very expensive, would encounter numerous logistical difficulties such as mountainous terrain, earthquakes, disputes with India, and potential terrorist attacks, and would barely make any impact on China's overall energy security, though Pakistan intends to build an oil pipeline to northern Pakistan that may allay much of these concerns.\n\nChinese goods flowing in the opposite direction may be able to find an easier, shorter and secure route to the Middle East. The city is also being developed as an export processing zone for foreign companies to manufacture in Gwadar before exporting to various countries in the region. The Government of Pakistan has committed to providing a base to China in Gwadar with the intention of helping secure the area.\n\nAlthough some analysts claim that China intends to establish a naval presence at Gwadar, others argue that China will be cautious about such a development. A Chinese military presence in Gwadar may provoke a significant reaction from both the United States and India.\n\nDue to the Chinese interest in the Gwadar port, Pakistan believes that Gwadar will become a regional hub, Prime Minister Imran Khan has laid down the foundation stone for the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIAP) at Gwadar on 29 March 2019. New Gwadar international airport is located in Gurandani which is around 26 kilometers northeast of Gwadar city in Balochistan province. It is expected to cost $246 million with an area of 4,300 acres and it will be able to handle big aircraft such as A380. The new airport will cater to domestic and international flights and will have open skies policy.\n\nIt will be a Greenfield airport with a cargo terminal handling capacity of 30,000 tones a year. It will have a single runway of 3,658 meters length and width of 75 meters to accommodate wide body aircraft, however an option to build a 2nd runway in future is also feasible. CAA Pakistan has awarded the design and construction contract to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), It is expected to be completed in 2022.\n\n\n * Gwadar International Airport\n * Gwadar Port\n * Islamabad\n * General Headquarters (GHQ)\n * Pakistan Government\n\n",

      "title": "Hanna Lake",
      "description": "Hanna Lake ( ہنہ جھيل) is a lake in Urak Valley near Quetta city in Balochistan Province in southwestern Pakistan. It is surrounded by mountains.\n\nHanna Lake is in the hills close to where the Urak Valley begins 17 km east from Quetta city. The reservoir was constructed in 1894 during the British Colonial era on the land of local tribesmen, and is one of the main attractions in the city and a great historical bridge wall between two mountains the depths like battlements of a fort for storing of water.\n\nThere is a lakeside restaurant with picnic tables shaded by pine trees at the end of the river where families can enjoy the food and weather on the eastern part the Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy (HDWSA) the first and only rowing, canoeing, kayaking and sailing training and championships organising centre in Balochistan Province with provision of rough swimming facility. Hanna Lake is one of the most visited and accessible lakes in Balochistan.\n\nIn 1894, the small action dam Surrpull (Red Bridge) was constructed on main Urak road to control flood and divert water catastrophically into Hanna Lake coming from the Zarghoon Ghar and Murddar Mountains Koh-i-Murdaar streams, snow melting and rains through its main canal.\n\nOver a century old in 1908, this lake was spread over an area of 818 acres with a holding capacity of over 220 million gallons of water and a depth of 49 ft.In 1973 a heavy flood destroyed the Murdar Mountains recharge linked canal on the way to Surrpull near Spin Kaarrez road which has not been (Restored) reconstructed till date.\n\nPresently on May 2016 the heavy flood filled this small action dam Surrpull with mud and stones resultantly all the streams and floods water are going waste and there is no chance to regulate water conservancy to Hanna lake without the restoration, Desilting of surrpull and both main canals on the other hand the water level in Hanna Lake is going deadly low hence the natural ecosystem wild life, environment of the surrounding, natives along with hundreds of migrated birds and thousands of fish followed by the future of the athletes of rowing and canoeing are in danger and on conclusion the Hanna Lake will be fully dried like in 1999 to January 2005 and in 2010.\n\nThe environmental scientists, Speleologists and the Conservationist are looking the future of the lake in most dangerous condition and the current harmful environment situations will badly affect the natural eco system, environment, underground water level of the surroundings, however the small action dam surpull was locally restored / desilted in February 2019 with the assistance of Hashim Khan Ghalzai secretary P&D and Hayatullah Khan Durrani C.E HDWSA and since the rain flood from Zarghoon mountains are continuesly coming to Hanna Lake and the water level has been raised up to 50%.\n\nOn 22 July 1986, Haji Khair Muhammad Khan Kakar Son of Sarfaraz Khan Kakar gifted 2 Acre (8093.71 square meter)of land on the North West edge of Hanna Lake to Hayatullah Khan Durrani known for caving and Mountaineering Adventure sports in Balochistan. Hayatullah Khan Durrani established Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy (HDWSA) on the eve of 14 August 1986 Pakistan Independence-Day the Balochistan's first and only Rowing, Canoeing, Kayaking, Sailing, rough swimming and boating academy where all such facilities regarding Rowing, Canoeing, Kayaking, Sailing, rough swimming training, events equipment’s and boating provides voluntary free of cost to the youth members at Hanna Lake.\n\nOn 6 July 1990, 40 people were killed and 8 injured when an overcrowded local tourists boat capsized in Hanna Lake. Most of the victims were on holiday. Another boat was used to rescue the victims.\n\nThis channel nowadays needs repairs and is wasting water and recently the Hanna Lake has been fully dried since August 2016 causing killing of thousands of fish and the future of the canoe Kayak and rowing National and International level is turning in to dark now. There is also a water channel which was constructed at the same time by the British to convert the snow and rain water near Spin Kaarez, coming from Murdar Mount, as surplus for filling the water in this lake. The channel was destroyed by a heavy flood in 1976 and has still not been re-constructed. The loss of the snow and rain water was wasted causing Hanna Lake to fully dry up between 1999 and January 2005. The government of Balochistan did nothing for the restoration of water level at Hanna lake but the Hanna Lake Development Authority (HLDA) the custodians of Hanna Lake and HDWSA officials had full efforts for the restoration of arrival of water through the surplus canal to Hanna Lake.\n\nFrom years 2000–2010 Hanna Lake dried up and the natives along with hundreds of migrated birds were in trouble.\n\nHowever, in 2011 the lake re-filled and once again gave rise to flora and fauna in its environment. The turquoise waters of the lake provide a rich contrast to the sandy brown of the hills in the background. One can promenade on the terraces or hire a boat and paddle on the lake and round the island in the middle.\n\n\n * Hanna-Urak Waterfall\n * Quetta\n * Urak Valley\n\n\n * Quetta-city.blogspot: Hanna Lake\n * Flickr: Hanna Lake and Mountains",

      "title": "Hingol National Park",
      "description": "Hingol National Park or Hungol National Park (undefined), covers an area of 6,100 km2. It was established in 1988. In 2004, the Makran Coastal Highway which links Karachi with the port town of Gwadar was opened.\n\nHingol National Park is along the Makran coast in southwestern Balochistan Province, southwestern Pakistan. It lies within sections of Lasbela District, Gwadar District, and Awaran District. The Gulf of Oman of the Arabian Sea are to the south. The provincial capital of Quetta is approximately 717 km. The provincial capital of Sindh is 190 km to the southeast on the coast.\n\nHingol National Park also includes famous Kund Malir Beach and Princess of Hope. In the past due to the political situation, people didn't prefer to go there. But now things have changed and many people go to Kund Malir on weekends from Karachi and other areas of Sindh to explore the beach.\n\n\n\nHingol National Park contains a variety of topographical features and habitats, varying from arid subtropical forest in the north to arid montane in the west. Large areas of the park are covered with drift sand and can be classified as coastal semi desert. The park includes the estuary of the Hungol River which supports a significant diversity of bird and fish species.\n\nSome 250 plant species were recorded in the initial surveys including 7 yet undescribed species. Many more species are yet to be collected.\n\nHingol National Park is known to support at least 35 species of mammals, 65 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 185 species of birds. The park forms an excellent habitat to wild Sindh ibex, Baluchistan urial, and chinkara gazelle. Ibex is found in all steep mountain ranges and are numerous in the Hinglaj and Rodani Kacho Mountain areas.

      "description": "Hazarganji Chiltan National Park is a national park in the Mastung District of western Balochistan Province of Pakistan. It lies between Chiltan on its west and Hazarganji on the east. The park was established in 1980 to provide the habitat to rare Chiltan ibexes found in the area.\n\nIt was established in 1980 and covers 325,000 acre of land located close to the Koh-i-Chiltan mountain in Quetta's outskirt.\n\nThe park is located in the Sulaiman Mountains, with desert and forest habitats, about 20 km southwest of the city of Quetta.\n\nThe name comes from the travelling route between the mountains called \"Hazarganji\", which means (of a thousand treasures) in native language as it was a historical passage for the Greco-Bactrian, the Mongols, the Scythians and migrating hordes of Baloch tribes.\n\nThe biodiversity of this park comprises 30 species of mammals (9 species of large mammals and 21 species of small mammals), 120 species of avifauna (36 resident and 84 migratory) and 30 species of reptiles.\n\nThe trees in the forests include Pashtun Juniper (Juniperus macropoda), pistachio, almond, and ash trees.\n\nThe fauna comprises about 300-400 rare Sulaiman Markhor and around 800 Chiltan ibex survive within the park boundaries. Few urials still survives in the western slopes between 1,500m to 2,100m. Other fauna includes Indian wolf, striped hyena, Baluchistan leopard, caracal, common jackal and Indian crested porcupine. Birds includes the very rare Houbara bustard, griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, crested honey buzzard (winters only), laggar falcon, peregrine falcon, common kestrel, Eurasian sparrowhawk (winters only), Indian scops owl, Indian cuckoo, European bee-eater (breeding only), chukar partridge, European nightjar (breeding/summer only), long-billed pipit, Eastern Orphean warbler, variable wheatear, blue rock thrush, whinchat, white-browed bush chat and Lichtenstein's desert finch and reptiles are also found here likes of monitor lizards, Russell's viper, saw-scaled vipers and spiny-tailed lizards.\n\n\n\nTotal 30 species of mammals include:\n\n\n\nThis train used to have a Quetta-Lahore route via Dera Ghazi Khan and Kot Adu Jn. This route opened in 1973, hence the Chiltan Express likely started operations on or after that year. Over the years the route of the Chiltan Express has been varied many times by running it between Quetta and Peshawar via Faisalabad, between Quetta and Rawalpindi via Lahore, and these days between Quetta and Lahore via Faisalabad.\n\n\n * کوہ چلتن\n * Lonely Planet: Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park\n * Wildlife Pakistan Website: park Information - Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park\n\nur:ہزار گنجی چلتن نیشنل پارک",

The site is one of the 19 Ramsar sites in Pakistan and was inducted in 2001.\n\nThe site is located at the edge of Gawater Bay along the delta of Dasht River near Jiwani town in Gwadar District of Balochistan. The wetland has an area of 11367 acre extending westward towards the Iranian border and is contiguous with the Govater Bay of Iran. Bay water is divided as Gawater Bay and Govater Bay. The eastern side of the coast is known as Dran and is composed of sandy beaches with rocky cliffs. Towards the Iranian border, it has a plain and low swampy geology. Climatic condition in the area is arid with very low rainfall. Dasht river is the main source of fresh water for the mangrove forest and the region along with seasonal runoff of rainwater from the nearby hills.\n\nJiwani coast provides two main ecological habitats; the mangrove swamps and the sandy beaches. The site near the delta is swampy and marshy and is covered with one of the three species of Mangroves in Pakistan; Avicennia marina. Jiwani is also an important nesting site for the endangered olive ridley and green turtles. The four turtle beaches where they nest are clustered on the eastern side of the coastline and are considered one of the most important marine turtle sites in Pakistan. Each year, thousands of migratory birds are sighted in the region. According to the book Avian Diversity of Jiwani Coastal Wetlands, Pakistan, 112 species of birds were recorded of which 79 species were migratory and 33 were resident. Of the 79 migratory species, 54 migrated during winters, 11 migrated during summers, 10 were year round visitors, and 3 species were vagrant.\n\nFishing is the major source of income for the locals however plans to grant fishing and offshore drilling rights to foreign firms have increased the concerns of conservation authorities. Local community uses the mangrove wood for domestic use which is threatening the mangrove forest. Balochistan Conservation Strategy to promote sustainable development in Balochistan emphasises the conservation of these coastal wetland. In 1999, WWF Pakistan initiated conservation drives, Mangrove Conservation Project and Turtle Conservation Project, to protect the wetlands from adverse effects and threats.\n\n\n\n\n * Wetlands of Pakistan\n * Protected areas of Pakistan\n\n* Comparative Avian Faunal Diversity of Jiwani Coastal Wetlands and Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary, Pakistan",

The largest compact block lies near Ziarat on an approximate range of about 700000 acre and is known as among the largest and oldest juniper forests in the world.in Kalat too many junipers in the fabled forest of Harboi have roots ringed with black soot remnants of many happy picnic visitors but symbolic of the stinging apathy of locals and a state that doesn’t place preservation high on its list of priorities.\n\nOn October 29, 2008 a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit Ziarat and surrounding areas. After the earthquake disruptions the local villagers are now using Juniper trees as fire wood. The juniper forest area is declining day by day there is lack of substantial remedial steps to minimize pressure on juniper cutting has ever been taken to save the centuries-old valuable trees. The local people living in these areas are not provided with the basic necessities of life. So, they exploit the forest resources for fuel, shelter and food. The major reason of decline of this forest is uses as firewood for daily use, timber for construction, hedges around agricultural fields by the local communities is resulting change in the environment and endangering the rare species of wildlife. Other threats to Juniper include the smuggling of juniper seeds and attack of plant parasite known as mistletoe (Arceuthobium oxycedri) which destroys it in short period. On 25 October 2010 The Government of Balochistan Sports, Environment and Youth Affairs Departments announced the Silver Jubilee “Juniper Defender Award” to Hayatullah Khan Durrani, for his long outstanding efforts as juniper defender since 1984. Hayat Durrani is an environmental analyst for the preservation of the 3000-year-old World Heritage of Juniperus macropoda Juniper forests and wildlife in the Ziarat and Zarghoon Ghar regions of Balochistan Pakistan.\n\nThere are many important species, bushes and ground flora etc. found here are associated with this species.

      "description": "Khuzdār (Brahui/; undefined) is the capital city of Khuzdar District in the central part of Balochistan Province, Pakistan. Historically, Khuzdar was the main city and capital of the Jhalawan province of the Khanate of Kalat. From October 1952 to 1955, it became part of the Balochistan States Union. In 1955, Khuzdar became the capital of the newly formed Kalat Division. Currently, Khuzdar is the third-largest city of Balochistan Province after Quetta and Turbat, and is also the largest Brahui-speaking city.\n\nKhuzdar appears as Khnenta in the Zend Avesta and is one of the sixteen beautiful lands created by Ahura Mazda. Khuzdar was the capital of the Brahui kingdom of Makran.\n\nIn the early 17th century it was part of the Jhalawan Kingdom, but it soon fell under the Khanate of Kalat, where it remained until a series of revolts during the reign of Khudadad Khan (1857–1893). By 1896, after Khudadad's death, the authority of Kalat was restored. Khuzdar was the capital and largest city of the Jhalawan province of the Khanate of Kalat.\n\nUnder a treaty with Kalat, the British appointed a political agent at Khuzdar in 1903. British assistance continued until 1947, after which the area was acceded to Pakistan and became a democracy. When the Baluchistan States Union became Kalat Division, Khuzdar was established as the divisional headquarters. The divisional administration of Pakistan ended in 2000. Khuzdar was again established as the Divisional headquarters in June 2009 by the Pakistan Peoples Party Government.\n\nKhuzdar serves as the learning center for the Balochistan province. The city has a number of government and private colleges, including the following:\n\n\n * Balochistan Residential College\n * Balochistan University of Engineering and Technology\n * Boys Degree College, Khuzdar\n * Divisional Public School and College, Khuzdar\n * Girls Degree College, Khuzdar\n * Government College of Elementary Education (Women), Khuzdar\n * Hamdam College of Education, Khuzdar\n * Jhalawan Law College\n * Jhalawan Medical College\n * Lasbela University of Agriculture, Water and Marine Science, Khuzdar campus\n * Pakistan Public School, Khuzdar\n * Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University, Khuzdar sub-campus\n * Shaheed Sikander Zarakzai University, Khuzdar\n * Sunrise Public School and College, Khuzdar\n * Workers Model Higher Secondary School\n\nKhuzdar is at the apex of a narrow valley at an elevation of 1237 m. Despite this altitude, Khuzdar like most of Balochistan has an arid climate (Köppen BWh) with very low and erratic rainfall. Unlike most parts of the province, the heaviest average rainfall comes from the Asian monsoon in July and August, though this rainfall tends to be very erratic and in many summers there is no significant rain at all.\n\n",

      "description": "Quetta (undefined Kwaṭa; ; undefined; ; formerly known as Shalkot (شالکوټ)) is the provincial capital and largest city of Balochistan, Pakistan. It was largely destroyed in the 1935 Quetta earthquake, but was rebuilt and has a population of 1,001,205 according to the census of 2017 while the Quetta District has a population of 2,275,699. Quetta is at an average elevation of 1680 m above sea level, making it Pakistan's only high-altitude major city. The city is known as the \"Fruit Garden of Pakistan,\" due to the numerous fruit orchards in and around it, and the large variety of fruits and dried fruit products produced there.\n\nLocated in northern Balochistan near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, Quetta is a trade and communication centre between the two countries. The city is near the Bolan Pass route which was once one of the major gateways from Central Asia to South Asia. Quetta played an important role militarily for the Pakistani Armed Forces in the intermittent Afghanistan conflict.\n\nQuetta, which is a variation of Kōṭ, is a Pashto word meaning \"fortress\".\n\n\n\nThe immediate area has long been one of pastures and mountains, with varied plants and animals relative to the dry plains to the west. The first record of Quetta is from 11th century CE, when it was captured by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi during his invasion of South Asia. In 1543, Mughal emperor Humayun came to Quetta en route to Safavid Persia, leaving his son and future Mughal emperor Akbar here. In 1709, the region was a part of Afghan Hotak dynasty and stayed a part until 1747 when Ahmed Shah Durrani conquered it and made it a part of Durrani Empire. The first European visited Quetta in 1828, describing it as mud-walled fort surrounded by three hundred mud houses.\n\nIn 1876 Quetta was occupied by the British and subsequently incorporated into British India. In 1856, British General John Jacob had urged his government to occupy Quetta given its strategic position on the western frontier. British Troops constructed the infrastructure for their establishment. By the time of the earthquake on 31 May 1935, Quetta had developed into a bustling city with a number of multistorey buildings and so was known as \"Little London\". The epicenter of the earthquake was close to the city and destroyed most of the city's infrastructure, killing an estimated 40,000 people.\n\n\n\nQuetta has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSk) with a significant variation between summer and winter temperatures. Summer starts about late May and goes on until early September with average temperatures ranging from 24 –. The highest temperature in Quetta is 42 C which was recorded on 10 July 1998. Autumn starts in late September and continues until mid-November with average temperatures in the 12 – range. Winter starts in late November and ends in late March, with average temperatures near 4 –. The lowest temperature in Quetta is -18.3 C which was recorded on 8 January 1970. Spring starts in early April and ends in late May, with average temperatures close to 15 °C. Unlike more easterly parts of Pakistan, Quetta does not have a monsoon season of heavy rainfall. Highest rainfall during 24 hours in Quetta is 113 mm which was recorded on 17 December 2000, Highest monthly rainfall of 232.4 mm was recorded in March 1982, also the year of the highest annual rainfall, at 949.8 mm. In the winter, snowfall has become quite erratic (December, January and February).\n\nThe city saw a severe drought from 1999 to 2001, during which the city did not receive snowfall and below normal rains. In 2003 the city received snow after a gap of five years. In 2004 and 2005, the city received normal rains after three years without snowfall while in 2006, 2007 and 2009 the city received no snow. In 2008 Quetta received a snowfall of 10 cm in four hours on 29 January, followed on 2 February by 25.4 cm in 10 hours – the city's heaviest snowfall in a decade. During the winter of 2010 it received no snow and saw below normal rains due to the presence of El-Nino over Pakistan.\n\nThe population of the city is around one million. In 2016, it was estimated at 1,140,000, but the 2017 Census revealed a total of 1,001,205. This makes it the largest city in Balochistan province and one of the major cities of Pakistan. The scholars disagree about the demographics of the city. According to some, the city has a Pashtun plurality followed by Baloch people, other indigenous people of Balochistan, Hazaras and lastly the settlers from other areas of Pakistan. Others think the city has a Pashtun majority followed by Balochs, Brahuis, Hazaras, Punjabis and Muhajir people. Urdu being national language is used and understood by all the residents and serves as a lingua franca.\n\nAccording to Reuters and the BBC, there are as many as 500,000-600,000 Shia Hazaras living in Quetta and its surrounding areas.\n\nAt the local level, the city is governed by a municipal corporation consisting of 66 ward members which elects a mayor and a deputy mayor.\n\nQuetta is on the western side of Pakistan and is connected to the rest of the country by a network of roads, railways and its international airport close to its center.\n\nAt an altitude of 1605 m above sea level, Quetta Airport is the second highest airport in Pakistan. Pakistan International Airlines has regular flights to and from the other major cities of Pakistan including Islamabad, Gwadar, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. Quetta Railway Station is one of the highest railway stations in Pakistan at 1676 m above sea level. The railway track was laid in the 1890s during the British era to link Quetta with rest of the country. The extensive network of Pakistan Railways connects Quetta to Karachi in the south, by a 863 km track, Lahore in the northeast (1,170 km or 727 miles) and Peshawar further northeast (1,587 km or 986 miles). A metalled road runs alongside the railway that connects Quetta to Karachi via the nearby town of Sibi to Jacobabad and Rohri in the plain of the River Indus.\n\nHanna Lake, which nestles in the hills ten kilometres (six miles) east of the city, is a turquoise body of water that contrasts markedly with the bare surrounding hills. It is an attractive destination for vacationers, with facilities for boat hire. A lakeside restaurant is crowded with hikers and campers during holiday periods. At one end there is an irrigation dam, while on the eastern shore there is Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy, the only water sports training center in Balochistan. The Hanna Lake Development Authority, the Hayat Durrani Water Sports Academy and Merck Marker have planted a range of trees in the Hanna Lake Mountains both for beautification and the protection of the environment.\n\nQuetta serves as the learning centre for the Balochistan province. The city has a number of government and private colleges, including the following:\n * University of Balochistan\n * [[Balochistan University of Information Technology Engineering and Management Sciences|Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences]] (BUITEMS)\n * Sardar Bahadur Khan Women's University\n * Islamia High School: It was frequently visited by Quaid-e-Azam in 1937 and was nicknamed as Chhota Aligarh (Little Aligarh) by him\n * St. Joseph's Convent School, Quetta\n * Bolan Medical College\n * Balochistan Agriculture College\n * Geological Survey of Pakistan\n * Tameer-e-Nau Public College\n * St Francis Grammar School\n * Command and Staff College\n * Quetta Institute of Medical Sciences\n\nCricket and football are the two most popular sports among the people of Quetta. However, a number of other sports are also played. This includes hockey, taekwondo, boxing, squash, mountaineering, Canoeing Rowing and bodybuilding.\n\nFootball teams from Quetta include Quetta Zorawar, Muslim FC, Hazara Green Football, Baluch Football and Quetta Bazigars Club. The Shaheed Nauoroz Stadium is the largest stadium in the city. The city also has Ayub National Stadium, a multipurpose stadium used for football and cricket and Bugti Stadium for cricket.\n\nThe Quetta Bears are a domestic cricket team represented the city in the List A and Twenty20 tournaments.

      "title": "Mehrgarh",
      "description": "Mehrgarh (Balochi: Mehrgaŕh; undefined;) is a Neolithic site (dated to 7000 BCE), which lies on the Kacchi Plain of Balochistan, Pakistan.\n\nMehrgarh is located near the Bolan Pass, to the west of the Indus River valley and between the present-day Pakistani cities of Quetta, Kalat and Sibi. The site was discovered in 1974 by an archaeological team directed by French archaeologists Jean-François Jarrige and Catherine Jarrige, and was excavated continuously between 1974 and 1986, and again from 1997 to 2000. Archaeological material has been found in six mounds, and about 32,000 artifacts have been collected. The earliest settlement at Mehrgarh—in the northeast corner of the 495 acre site—was a small farming village dated between 7000 BCE and 5500 BCE.\n\nMehrgarh is now seen as a precursor to the Indus Valley Civilization, displaying the whole sequence from earliest settlement and the start of agriculture, to the mature Harappan Civilisation.\n\nMehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia. Mehrgarh was influenced by the Near Eastern Neolithic, with similarities between \"domesticated wheat varieties, early phases of farming, pottery, other archaeological artefacts, some domesticated plants and herd animals.\" According to Parpola, the culture migrated into the Indus Valley and became the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nJean-Francois Jarrige argues for an independent origin of Mehrgarh. Jarrige notes \"the assumption that farming economy was introduced full-fledged from Near-East to South Asia,\" and the similarities between Neolithic sites from eastern Mesopotamia and the western Indus valley, which are evidence of a \"cultural continuum\" between those sites. But given the originality of Mehrgarh, Jarrige concludes that Mehrgarh has an earlier local background,\" and is not a \"'backwater' of the Neolithic culture of the Near East.\"\n\nLukacs and Hemphill suggest an initial local development of Mehrgarh, with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population. According to Lukacs and Hemphill, while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of Mehrgarh, which \"suggests moderate levels of gene flow.\" They wrote that \"the direct lineal descendents of the Neolithic inhabitants of Mehrgarh are to be found to the south and the east of Mehrgarh, in northwestern India and the western edge of the Deccan plateau,\" with neolithic Mehrgarh showing greater affinity with chalocolithic Inamgaon, south of Mehrgarh, than with chalcolithic Mehrgarh.\n\nGallego Romero et al. (2011) state that their research on lactose tolerance in India suggests that \"the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Iran and the Middle East.\" Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is \"characteristic of the common European mutation.\" According to Romero, this suggests that \"the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India – likely traveling along the coast of the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found.\" They further note that \"[t]he earliest evidence of cattle herding in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.\"\n\nArchaeologists divide the occupation at the site into eight periods.\n\nThe Mehrgarh Period I (7000 BCE-5500 BCE) was Neolithic and aceramic, without the use of pottery. The earliest farming in the area was developed by semi-nomadic people using plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as sheep, goats and cattle. The settlement was established with simple mud buildings and most of them had four internal subdivisions. Numerous burials have been found, many with elaborate goods such as baskets, stone and bone tools, beads, bangles, pendants and occasionally animal sacrifices, with more goods left with burials of males. Ornaments of sea shell, limestone, turquoise, lapis lazuli and sandstone have been found, along with simple figurines of women and animals. Sea shells from far sea shore and lapis lazuli found as far away as present-day Badakshan, Afghanistan shows good contact with those areas. A single ground stone axe was discovered in a burial, and several more were obtained from the surface. These ground stone axes are the earliest to come from a stratified context in South Asia. Periods I, II and III are contemporaneous with another site called Kili Gul Mohammed.\n\nThe aceramic Neolithic phase in the region is now called 'Kili Gul Muhammad phase', and it is dated 7000-5000 BC. Yet the Kili Gul Muhammad site, itself, may have started c. 5500 BC.\n\nIn 2001, archaeologists studying the remains of two men from Mehrgarh made the discovery that the people of the Indus Valley Civilization had knowledge of proto-dentistry from the early Harappan periods. In April 2006, it was announced in the scientific journal Nature that the oldest (and first early Neolithic) evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo (i.e. in a living person) was found in Mehrgarh. According to the authors, their discoveries point to a tradition of proto-dentistry in the early farming cultures of that region. \"Here we describe eleven drilled molar crowns from nine adults discovered in a Neolithic graveyard in Pakistan that dates from 7,500 to 9,000 years ago. These findings provide evidence for a long tradition of a type of proto-dentistry in an early farming culture.\"\n\nThe Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE–4800 BCE) and Merhgarh Period III (4800 BCE–3500 BCE) were ceramic Neolithic, using pottery, and later chalcolithic. Period II is at site MR4 and Period III is at MR2. Much evidence of manufacturing activity has been found and more advanced techniques were used. Glazed faience beads were produced and terracotta figurines became more detailed. Figurines of females were decorated with paint and had diverse hairstyles and ornaments. Two flexed burials were found in Period II with a red ochre cover on the body. The amount of burial goods decreased over time, becoming limited to ornaments and with more goods left with burials of females. The first button seals were produced from terracotta and bone and had geometric designs. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft kilns, large pit kilns and copper melting crucibles. There is further evidence of long-distance trade in Period II: important as an indication of this is the discovery of several beads of lapis lazuli, once again from Badakshan. Mehrgarh Periods II and III are also contemporaneous with an expansion of the settled populations of the borderlands at the western edge of South Asia, including the establishment of settlements like Rana Ghundai, Sheri Khan Tarakai, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur and Ghaligai.\n\nPeriod IV was 3500 to 3250 BCE. Period V from 3250 to 3000 BCE and period VI was around 3000 BCE. The site containing Periods IV to VII is designated as MR1.\n\nSomewhere between 2600 BCE and 2000 BCE, the city seems to have been largely abandoned in favor of the larger and fortified town Nausharo five miles away when the Indus Valley Civilization was in its middle stages of development. Historian Michael Wood suggests this took place around 2500 BCE.\n\nThe last period is found at the Sibri cemetery, about 8 kilometers from Mehrgarh.\n\nEarly Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BCE to 2600 BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. Mehrgarh is probably the earliest known center of agriculture in South Asia.\n\nThe oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old wheel-shaped copper amulet found at Mehrgarh. The amulet was made from unalloyed copper, an unusual innovation that was later abandoned.\n\n\n\nThe oldest ceramic figurines in South Asia were found at Mehrgarh. They occur in all phases of the settlement and were prevalent even before pottery appears. The earliest figurines are quite simple and do not show intricate features. However, they grow in sophistication with time and by 4000 BC begin to show their characteristic hairstyles and typical prominent breasts. All the figurines up to this period were female. Male figurines appear only from period VII and gradually become more numerous. Many of the female figurines are holding babies, and were interpreted as depictions of the \"mother goddess\". However, due to some difficulties in conclusively identifying these figurines with the \"mother goddess\", some scholars prefer using the term \"female figurines with likely cultic significance\".\n\nEvidence of pottery begins from Period II. In period III, the finds become much more abundant as the potter's wheel is introduced, and they show more intricate designs and also animal motifs. The characteristic female figurines appear beginning in Period IV and the finds show more intricate designs and sophistication. Pipal leaf designs are used in decoration from Period VI. Some sophisticated firing techniques were used from Period VI and VII and an area reserved for the pottery industry has been found at mound MR1. However, by Period VIII, the quality and intricacy of designs seem to have suffered due to mass production, and due to a growing interest in bronze and copper vessels.\n\nThere are two types of burials in the Mehrgarh site. There were individual burials where a single individual was enclosed in narrow mud walls and collective burials with thin mud brick walls within which skeletons of six different individuals were discovered. The bodies in the collective burials were kept in a flexed position and were laid east to west. Child bones were found in large jars or urn burials (4000~3300 BCE).\n\nMetal finds have dated as early as Period IIB, with a few copper items.\n\nMehrgarh is now seen as a precursor to the Indus Valley Civilization. According to Ahmad Hasan Dani, professor emeritus of archaeology at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, \"discoveries at Mehrgarh changed the entire concept of the Indus civilization [...] There we have the whole sequence, right from the beginning of settled village life.\"\n\n\n * Indus Valley Civilization and the list of Indus Valley Civilization sites\n * List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization\n * Hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilization\n * Bhirrana\n * Mundigak — archaeological site in Kandahar Province\n * Hadda — archaeological site in Nangarhar Province\n * Surkh Kotal — archaeological site in Baghlan Province\n * Mes Aynak — archaeological site in Logar Province\n * Sheri Khan Tarakai — archaeological site in Bannu\n * Mohenjo-daro — archaeological site in Sindh\n * Harappa — archaeological site in Punjab\n * Bolan Pass\n * Nausharo\n * Pirak\n * Chanhudaro\n * Quetta\n * List of Stone Age art\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n * Mehrgarh\n * Jarrige, Jean-Franois, Mehrgarh Neolithic\n * Jarrige, C, J.

      "description": "Moola Chotok (Urdu:) is a hidden ravine located in the middle of the Khuzdar District in the southern province of Balochistan, Pakistan. It is situated approximately 80 km north-east of Khuzdar at an elevation of 1237 m. Surrounded by tall cliffs, the cascading waterfall, known as Chotok, is one of the biggest waterfalls of Sub Tehsil Moola.\n\nKhuzdar appears as Khnenta in the Zend Avesta and is one of the sixteen beautiful lands created by Ahura Mazda. Khuzdar was the capital of the Brahui kingdom of Makran.\n\nRuins of Thore kheer, Hitachi, Harav, Kial Being and Pasta Khan reveal the belonging of Moola to the 2,000-year-old civilization. Moola River, located in the mountains of Dist Khuzdar, is the largest river of the Khuzdar region that flows throughout the year. Moola Valley is a 1237 meter long bow-shaped region, 80 km away from Khuzdar District. It is named after the Moola Village and River, which flows through the length of the valley. The valley is home to several mountain ranges, salt mines, lakes, and waterfalls.\n\nJahan is one of the most beautiful villages of Sub Tehsil Moola. The population is estimated to be over 20,000. The local language of Moola Chotok is Brahui.\n\nIn summer, it is one of the hottest places in the country like Sibi and Dhadar. In winter, it is one of the coldest places. Temperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs commonly exceeding 120 °F (48.9 °C) and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below freezing point. Weather conditions can greatly affect hiking and valley exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures and late summer monsoons.\n\n\n * Chotok Waterfalls\n * List of districts of Balochistan\n\n\n * Moola Chotok - Khuzdar Dawn Newspaper\n * Moola Chotok - A Hidden Paradise of Balochistan",

      "title": "Ziarat",
      "description": "Ziarat (undefined) is a city and the capital of Ziarat District, Balochistan Province, Pakistan. It is a holiday resort, about 130 km from the capital city of Balochistan province Quetta. The famous Quaid-e-Azam Residency is also there in the valley, where Quaid spent a few of his most memorable days. Tourists from all over Balochistan and also from Sindh province visit the valley in the harsh summers. Its overall cold weather, fascinating sceneries, lush green forests and mighty mountains attracts tourists of all kinds.\n\nMay to September are months of peak tourist visits. Specially in the days of Eid festive and other national or religious the valley is full packed. The 2016's Eid experienced about 0.4 million people visiting.\n\nThe hill station is easily accessible from Quetta through a Highway. While accessing it from Loralai is little difficult due to bad road conditions. The third way of accessing the valley is through Harnai District although it is pretty dangerous near Dumiara waterfall, due to the very steep and unpaved road.\n\n\n\nThe main road of the station is Jinnah road which also called the red zone of the valley due to a large numbers of government and askari resorts and buildings there, a few of which are:\n * Frontier Corps Resthouse\n * Governor House\n * IG Police House\n * Panther Lodge (Army)\n * Juniper Lodge (Army)\n * Quaid-e-Azam Residency\n * Commissioner House\n * CM Balochistan House\n\n\n\nNear Ziarat is a juniper forest also called sanober, which features the species Juniperus macropoda ''Juniperus excelsa polycarpos. '' Pakistan's largest juniper forest is located in this reserve. The ecosystem is of inestimable value for biodiversity conservation. It is also of great ecological significance, providing local, regional, and global benefits.\n\n\n\nThe biosphere reserve is home to the largest area of juniper forest (Juniperus excelsa) in Pakistan, covering about 110,000 hectares. It is believed that the forest is the second largest of its kind in the world. The juniper species found there are of global significance because of their advanced age and slow growth rate. In fact, the junipers of Ziarat are among the oldest living trees in the world. Although no dendrological study has yet been conducted, according to one estimate, the age of a mature tree in Ziarat can exceed 5,000 years. Local people refer to the trees as \"living fossils\". Their remarkable longevity allows research on past weather conditions in the region, making the species of particular significance for studies on climate change and ecology. The juniper forest ecosystem of Ziarat provides a habitat for endangered wildlife species and supports a rich variety of plant species. Because of the ecosystem's biodiversity, various parts of it have been designated protected areas, including wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves. The mountain ranges, including the Khilafat Hills, consist of a core habitat that reportedly hosts several globally important wild species, among them markhors, urials, black bears and wolves. The forest also serves as a habitat for a number of other animals: Afghan pikas, foxes, jackals and several species of migratory birds. However, anthropological factors such as illegal hunting, human habitations and livestock grazing have encroached on the wildlife habitats, leading to their fragmentation. The human population, distributed across various sub-tribes and clans, is concentrated in valleys, although small settlements are visible on mountain slopes. There are over 100,000 people living within or in close proximity to the biosphere reserve, most of whom are agropastoralists. Almost 40 percent of the population migrates for three to four months during the winter to abodes in Harnai. Livestock was formerly the primary source of livelihood in the reserve. Today, it has been displaced by the development of agriculture and, in particular, the promotion of horticultural crops such as apple and cherry orchards.\n\nZiarat and the surrounding juniper valleys offer good opportunities for hiking and trekking, as well as various gorges. The city is also becoming popular for a taste of snowfall during the winter.\n\n\n\nZiarat is the location of the Ziarat residency where Jinnah spent the last days of his life. The residency, constructed in 1892, is a wooden structure with great architectural importance. It was originally meant to be a sanatorium, but was converted into the summer residence of the Agent of the Governor General. It is now a national monument. The residency catches tourists' attention because of its location and hilly surroundings. There is a small dam, and the valley is full of fruits: cherry in summer and apple in winter. Between the hills and the deep ravine, there is a mile-long stretch of flat land ideal for walking. This is the Chashma Walk, which leads to the spring, or “chashma\", that provides water for the town.\n\nThe highest spot that cars can reach is Prospect Point, which is 2,713 metres above sea level and offers a view of the valley stretching out in undulating slopes, about 6 km from Ziarat. From a nearby cliff, one can clearly see the highest peak of the Khilifat Hills. There is a small rest house nearby. Bookings can be made through the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Ziarat. Sandman Tangi, 4 km from Ziarat, features a dramatic waterfall, and about 13 km from the city is Dumiara, another waterfall. The Chutair Valley is about a 30-minute drive from Ziarat. Inhabitants of the valley live in huts made from juniper bark, distinct from the homes in other villages.\n\nBalochistan is an arid region and receives very little annual rainfall. But innumerable streams and natural springs known as karez can be found in most parts of the province. There are more than a half dozen gorges around Ziarat formed by karez spring water falling through narrow openings in the mountain rocks, producing a dramatic effect. The gorges along the road to Ziarat are Chutair Tangi, Kahn Tangi, Kawas Tangi, Faran Tangi and Sandman Tangi.\n\nThe residents of Ziarat are mainly Pashtun, including Tareen, Kakar, Syed, Taran, Dotani, Raisani and Dummer tribes. The Sarangzai and Panezai, subsets of the Kakar tribe, account for about half of the district's population.\n\nThe shrine of Nau Gaza Baba, surrounded by large graveyards, is 1 km from the town of Ziarat. Nau Gaza Baba, whose real name was Kareemdad Khan, was the chief of the Essakhail Sanerzai tribe. Legend holds that when he died, his body grew by nine (nau) yards (gaz), so people started to call him Nau Gaza Baba. Many miracles are attributed to him. He had disciples from the Tareen, Pechi, Syed, and Wanechi (Tareen) tribes, and many people visit the shrine to pray.\n\nThe shrine of Baba Kharwari, a member of the Sarangzai tribe named Tahir, is 8 km from the town. He was a disciple of Nana Sahib, and a number of miracles are attributed to him. Many people visit his shrine and offer sacrifices in his memory. During the Eid festival, tribesmen gather around the shrine and hold wrestling and marksmanship competitions.\n\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Ziarat's climate as cold semi-arid (BSk). Temperatures in December and January often exceed -15 °C. Most of the city's precipitation is in the form of snow.\n\nOn 29 October 2008, at around 4 am, Ziarat and surrounding areas were struck by an earthquake doublet. The first tremor, 6.2 magnitude, lasted a couple of seconds, and was followed by a magnitude-6.4 tremor that lasted almost 30 seconds, destroying many mud houses and several government buildings.\n\nNeighbouring villages were also badly affected by the earthquake. More than 200 people were killed, and over 50,000 were left homeless. Landslides cut off many roads, making the area less accessible to emergency responders. Pakistani military helicopters were used to reach mountainous and remote locations. Aftershocks were felt in the city of Quetta, causing widespread alarm. The rescue and relief squad of the Chiltan Adventurers Association Balochistan, sponsored by Pakistan Customs Quetta, distributed relief goods to remote areas; the same squad had worked with a Chinese search and rescue team after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, which killed over 75,000 people.\n\nPakistan sits atop an area of continental collision between the Eurasian, Iranian Plateau and Indian tectonic plates, the same force that created the Himalayan mountains. In 1935, Quetta was almost completely destroyed by an earthquake that claimed the lives of about 30,000 people.\n\n* Quaid-e-Azam Residency\n\n",

The area of these forests is 99960 hectares. In 1977, UNESCO declared it biosphere reserve. Its area is 110000 hectares and it is largest juniper forest in Pakistan, according to another source. The age of old trees is 5000 to 7000 years for which they are called living fossils. This forest is also a world heritage site. Trees of this forest are also included in oldest living trees on the earth. Many endangered species like suleiman markhor, urial, black bear and wolf, as well as migratory birds and animals are also found here. 54 different species of plants are found here. About half of them are used in medicines to treat different diseases. These forests also prevent water reserves from evaporating, which are major source of livelihood for local people.\n\n",

      "title": "Chaukhandi tombs",
      "description": "The Chaukhandi (undefined; چوڪُنڊي ) tombs form an early Islamic cemetery situated 29 km east of Karachi, in the Sindh province of Pakistan. The tombs are notable for their elaborate sandstone carvings. The tombs are similar in style to the elaborate tombs at the Makli Necropolis near Thatta, and are built in the funerary architectural style typical of lower Sindh.\n\nGenerally, the tombs are attributed to the Jokhio (also spelt Jokhiya) and known as the family graveyard of the Jokhio tribe, although other, mainly Baloch, tribes have also been buried here. They were mainly built during Mughal rule sometime in the 15th and 18th centuries when Islam became dominant.\n\nThis type of graveyard in Sindh and Baluchistan is remarkable because of its main north-south orientation. The more elaborate graves are constructed with a buff-colored sandstone, which has often kept remarkably well over time in the arid local climate. Tombs were constructed either as single graves or as groups of up to eight graves, raised on a common platform.\n\nA typical sarcophagus consists of six vertical slabs, with two long slabs on each side of the grave indicating the length of the body and the remaining two vertical slabs on the head and foot side. These six slabs are covered by a second sarcophagus consisting of six more similar vertical slabs but smaller in size, giving the grave a pyramid shape. The upper box is further covered with four or five horizontal slabs and the topmost construction is set vertically with its northern end often carved into a knob known as a crown or a turban. The tombs are embellished with geometrical designs and motifs, including figural representations such as mounted horsemen, hunting scenes, arms, and jewelry.\n\nThe earliest -passing- reference of the Chaukhandi tombs (a.k.a. Jokundee) is in a letter of J. Macleod, addressed to H. B. E. Frere in 1851. The tombs, however, were given more serious attention for the first time by H. D. Baskerville, the Assistant Collector of Thatta in Karachi district in 1917. The tombs near Landhi were included in the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 in 1922.\n\nDr. Salome Zajadacz-Hastenrath summarizes earlier research on these and similar tombs in Sindh as follows:\n\nA cemetery of this type was discovered at the turn of the 20th century in Hinidan by Major M. A. Tighe, Political Agent in southern Balochistan. J. P. Vogel was the first to investigate this and other cemeteries – including Karpasan (a plateau south of Hinidan), Gundar (a village near Dinga, south of Hinidan), and Manghopir – and he drew attention to another cemetery discovered by Captain Showers, Political Agent in Kalat, lying between the Hub River and Sonmiani. Vogel recognized that the tombs were Islamic, as indicated by the use of the Arabic script and the alignment of the monuments. According to Islamic custom, the dead are laid to rest in such a way that they are facing Mecca, resting on their right shoulder. Mecca lies approximately to the west of Sindh; the longitudinal axis of the tombs accordingly lies more or less in a north-south direction, with the head always lying in the north.\n\nIn (...) 1910, Sir Thomas Holdich described a similar cemetery near Malir and also referred to several other cemeteries. He stated that local tradition ascribed these to the 'Kalmati' Balochis, and he linked this name to the town of Kalmat on the Makran Coast.\n\nIn 1917, H. D. Baskerville discovered a similar cemetery in the vicinity of the village of Chaukhandi, near Karachi. Baskerville's published report raised the question of a possible above-ground burial – but he dismissed this after a careful investigation of one of the stone chambers in the cemetery, which did not contain any remains. A number of tomb inscriptions were found at the Chaukhandi cemetery, consisting of names and/or sayings from the Quran. Some of the named dead were said to belong to the Jokhiya tribe, still resident in the vicinity. Only one of the tombs was dated – the date of death being inscribed on it with the numbers in reverse order – as AH 1169 (AD 1756). Jokhio, Jokhia or Jokhiya (Urdu:جوکھيو) are said to be descendants of the Samma (tribe) of Sindh.\n\nIn 1925, Henry Cousens devoted a chapter of his book on the antiquities of Sindh to 'Baloch tombs'. He studied the tombs in Jarak (now spelt Jerruck), Sonda and Kharkharo, which were of the same type as Chaukhandi. Referring to the studies by G. E. L. Carter, he noted that more than twenty such cemeteries had been identified, and rejected the theory regarding above-ground burials, pointing to the frequent occurrence of arcade-like perforations in the lower casket. Cousens was the first to draw comparisons with other architectural monuments in Sindh, and he refers to similarities between the decoration of a tomb in Sonda and the tombs of Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro (Shah Wardi Khan) (d. 1772) in Hyderabad as well as the tomb of the Samma king, Jam Nizamuddin II (reigned 1461–1509), an impressive square structure built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions. Comparable is also the mausoleum of Isa Khan Tarkhan the Younger (d. 1644) in the necropolis of Makli Hill. Regarding the covering of the tombs with chattris (cupola's or pavilions), he points to similar tombs in the same Makli necropolis and to the tomb of Mir Masum in Sukkur. He considered the tombs to be of approximately the same date as the tombs of Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro - i.e. the second half of the 18th century. Cousens pointed out that depictions of riders, as seen on some of the tombs, are also found on sati (shrine) stones in Kathiawar and Kutch.\n\nInformation about a single tomb of this type in the vicinity of the village of Baghwana, south-west of the Las Bela (princely state), was published in 1931 by Sir Aurel Stein. According to local tradition the tomb was that of Mai Masura, a saintly beggar women; legend had it that the stone slabs had miraculously flown through the air from Kandahar. Stein considered it to date from the end of the 15th century.\n\nIn 1934, in a publication concerning monuments of Sindh, Nani Gopala Majumdar described a funerary enclosure on Tharro Hill near Gujjo. He believed that that cemetery enclosure dated from the 14th century, being therefore older than the monuments on Makli Hill; he also found some additional tombs of lesser significance in the vicinity of the nearby mausoleum of Sheikh Turabi. After the Second World War the Chaukhandi tombs did not receive any attention from the Pakistan authorities until Dr. I. H. Qureshi, a renowned historian and the then education minister (later Chancellor of Karachi University), drew the attention of the Department of Archeology and Museums to them, having received a letter on the subject from Zahid Hussain, Governor of State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nThe then Director General of the Department of Archeology and Museums, Shaikh Khurshid Hasan, confessed that at first his department did not even realize that the tombs were protected under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904. Soon the department realized its mistake and started taking some measures for the protection of the necropolis.\n\nIn the post-independence era a first serious study was undertaken by Mumtaz Hassan; he described Chaukhandi tombs as Baloch tombs. Subsequently, many articles appeared in the national newspapers but the mystery as to their origin could not be solved.\n\nMs. E-J.W. Bunting, along with Dr. F. A. Khan, Justice Feroz Nana and S. A. Naqvi started preparing rubbings of stone carvings and provided further publicity by exhibitions abroad of these rubbings. The exhibition in the USA in particular aroused great interest amongst the scholars in the studies of various aspects of the Chaukhandi tombs.\n\nIn his first paper based on epigraphical-cum-historical studies, Shaikh Khurshid Hasan observed that the Chaukhandi graveyard near Landhi was predominantly a graveyard of the Jokhio tribe, although some tombs of the Burfat and Sheikh tribes could also been found. In a 1984 article on the Chaukhandi tombs Shaikh Khurshid Hasan mainly dealt with the decorative elements of the stone carving. In the following years he continued to publish on the gravestones and inscriptions. For further reading see also Shaikh Khurshid Hasan's comprehensive study.\n\nIn 1978 Salome Zajadacz-Hastenrath published a book in which in which she mainly dealt with the stylistic evolution of Chaukhandi tombs. Comparing Chaukhandi tombs (tombs of particular types and forms thereof) among each other, a typological framework was established and consequently a relative chronology. By comparing this framework with dated structures, mainly of Makli Hill but also of other sites, the study arrived at dates for the various stages of evolution of the Chaukhandi tombs. Beside the Chaukhandi tombs strictly speaking, the study also dealt with specific aspects such as the 'Form of the tombstones', 'Riders, weapons, and other depictions on men's graves', 'Jewellery depictions on women's graves', articles which all show the richness of the Chaukhandi funerary art. The documentary part of the book included a list of dated stonemasonry patterns on Chaukhandi tombs.\n\nHer study was mainly based on photographs taken of a total of 50 cemeteries and tombs; the book includes a representative selection of 112 photographs. A catalogue of the cemeteries visited provides details on their locations, and the number, types and conditions of individual tombs. It covered an area reaching from the Hub River in the west up to the region of Tando Muhammad Khan and of Shah Kapur in the east.\n\nZajadacz-Hastenrath concluded that the Chaukhandi tombs had developed far beyond a kind of folkloristic specialty; they evolved from traditional forms of tombs widely spread in the Lower Sindh ( e.g. on Makli Hill, but there with richer forms, Kathiawar and Gujarat) to graves with a monumental quality, achieved by their unusual height, coupled with strong sculptural decorations. The apex of this development was reached during the first half of the 17th century of which fine examples were shown in figures 34, 35 and 36 of the study (the author called these 'Tombs with projecting surfaces'). Unique in the Islamic architectural tradition, the author considered the Chaukhandi tombs a most original and independent contribution to Islamic sepulchral architecture and ornamental sculpture.\n\nThe notable character of her study was underlined in the Encyclopedia of Islam. While dealing with the various types of sepulchral structures on the South Asia and referring to the study of Zajadacz-Hastenrath, the author of that article stressed that it was only in the case of the Chaukhandi tombs that such a systematic research had been done. In 2003 (i.e. after the author's decease in 1998), an English translation of the book was published in Pakistan.\n\nPakistani professor Mirza Mahad Baig visited Sindh at the end of the 20th century and examined some of the tombs. He pointed out to Rajput influences in the Chaukhandi necropolis. He mentioned that it is well known that many Munda warrior groups have family ties with the so-called Rajput tribes of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Some Rajput tribes, namely the Jokhio, the satlari, emigrated from Kutch (Gujarat) and Rajputana towards the Sindh and Makran regions during the Samma Dynasty. These tribes had close relations among each other, including matrimonial ties, both within their own group as well as with the Baloch tribe of the Kalmatis. His hypothesis suggested a tribal Rajput origin in the utilization not only of the monolithic slabs and pedestals in the step-shaped graves, but also in the naive decoration of some tombs, resembling a house facade, or a human face as if drawn by a child. The decoration of the tombs (mostly with geometric motifs) seems derived from wood sculpture. With a few exceptions human figures are avoided, in accordance with Islamic beliefs.\n\nFurther articles on the structural development of stone-carved graves were written by Kaleem Lashari  Later, Lashari highlighted the Bhawani Serai and the Tutai Chaukhandi graveyards, and called for urgent  conservation.\n\nThere are various opinions as to the meaning of the word Chaukhandi. Shaikh Khurshid Hasan writes: Some scholars believed that Chaukhandi is the name of a place. Others take it to be an architectural term. On the necropolis of 'Chaukhandi' stands the tomb of one Jam Murid bin Haji, which contains the word Chaukhandi, along with the name of the deceased. Shaikh Khurshid Hasan therefore considered Chaukhandi to be the name of the place. More so, when Banerji visited the Chaukhandi graveyard in 1920, he referred [to] it as \"the little village Chaukhandi\". According to Mumtaz Hassan, Chaw in Sindhi language means four and Khundi corner or pillar. Chaukhandi would refer to the four pillars supporting the umbrella shaped dome over the tomb and would apply to all tombs having the same construction. However, this argument has flaws because all the tombs covered with umbrella shaped domes or with a rectangular pavilion at Chaukhandi have more than four pillars or columns. Even at Mangophir, a canopy over similar graves has more than four pillars. As regards to the suggestion that Chaukhandi is the name of a place, Mumtaz Hassan feels that such a view derives from the fact that the name Chaukhandi had come to be associated with the tombs near Landhi. As mentioned above, on one tomb the word Chaukhandi is engraved. That might signify the location rather than the structural style of the monument. It is therefore possible that the word Chaukhandi, originally referring to the style of construction, became associated with one particular site.\n\n[Ali Ahmad] Brohi's view on the other hand is that Chaukhandi is used for a domed roof, a kind of chhattri (umbrella/pavilion) which is supported by four to eight pillars, whiereby the sides are left open. According to Kaleem Lashari, the word Chaukhandi as inscribed on the grave of Jam Murid bin Haji is a compound word with Sahib and is to be read as such Sahib-e-Chaukhandi and not on its own. He compares it to the [Sahib-e-Jaidad (Owner of a land)]. It clarifies that Jam Murid is the owner of the Chaukhandi or that the Chaukhandi is erected over his grave. In support of his theory he refers to a similar inscription on a grave at Got Raj Malik and, therefore, does not agree that Chaukhandi is the name of a place.\n\nDr. Baloch has further tried to explain the meaning of the word Chaukhandi. Literally, it suggests a four walled enclosure open from above. In the cultural tradition of Sindh, such a walled enclosure is called a Chaukhandi, which is constructed out of respect around the grave of a revered person. Chaukhandi as such is therefore not a grave or tomb in itself, but the four walled enclosure in which the person(s) has been buried. Referring to the burial place, it would be called Chaukhandi\n\nSalome Zajadacz-Hastenrath is of the opinion that the original age and history of Chaukhandi tombs are still entirely unclear. She writes The tombs are often referred to as 'Baloch Tombs' – a name based on local traditions linking the tombs to various tribal groups, namely the Burfat, Kalamati, Jakhara and Jokhiya. The fact that the cemeteries lie in an area in which the Balochis are either the only ethnic group or live alongside other tribes provides support for this description.\n\nHowever, the area across which the cemeteries are spread is by no means identical with that of the Balochis, but includes only a tiny fraction of it. For this reason, the term 'Baloch tombs' does not appear very accurate. It suggests the conclusion that this type of tomb is a peculiarity of the Balochis and might be explained in some way through the common culture and history of the tribe as a whole – although there is no evidence of this. It would seem to make better sense to assign to the tombs the name of the subgroup of the tribe to which they can genuinely be traced – assuming that this could be identified with any precision. Similar difficulties arise when one attempts to attribute the tombs to any tribe other than the Balochis.\n\nSalome Zajadacz-Hastenrath also comments on Mumtaz Hassan's theory and says \"(...) it does not seem possible to establish a convincing connection between the word 'Chaukhandi' and the tombs themselves. Admittedly, the word is also used to refer to other square structures – for example, the Chaukhandi Stupa in Sarnath. The Chaukhandi tombs themselves are also 'square' in contrast to the round or oval tombs that are also seen in Sindh and Balochistan; but, as a characteristic, this lacks the striking quality that might justify the use of this name for them.\" In her book she says the generic term Chaukhandi tombs is used in the sense of tombs resembling those found at the cemetery in Chaukhandi.\n\n\n * List of mausolea\n * Necropolis\n * Sindhology\n\n\n * INCPak: The Historical Cemetery\n * INCPak: Images of Chukhandi Cemetery By Farhan Imaan F.Abro\n * Chaukhandi Art.com\n * Pakwheels.com: Chaukhandi tombs\n * Ayaz.com: Photos of Chaukhandi graves\n * Dukandar.com: Chaukhandi Tombs",

      "title": "Empress Market",
      "description": "The Empress Market (undefined, Sindhi: ايمپريس مارڪيٽ) is a marketplace situated in the Saddar Town locality of Karachi, Pakistan. The market traces its origins to the British Raj era, when it was first constructed. Today, it is amongst the most popular and busy places for shopping in Karachi. Commodities sold in the Empress Market range from condiments, fruit, vegetables and meat to stationery material, textiles and pets.\n\nThe Empress Market was constructed between 1884 and 1889 and was named to commemorate Queen Victoria, Empress of India. The market was constructed at a well-chosen site that was clearly visible from a great distance. The site of the market had historical significance as it was situated on the grounds where a number of native sepoys were executed in a ruthless fashion after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. Accounts mention that the sepoys had their heads blown off by cannonballs in an attempt to suppress any mutinous feelings among the locals. The British fearing that the local population will build a monument to honor the executed sepoys instead built the Empress Market to commemorate Queen Victoria.\n\nThe foundation stone of the Empress Market was laid by the-then Governor of Bombay, James Fergusson in 1884, who also laid the foundation of the Merewether Memorial Tower. It was designed by James Strachan (architect), the foundations were completed by the English firm of A.J. Attfield, and the building was constructed by the local firm of ‘Mahoomed Niwan and Dulloo Khejoo’. The building was arranged around a courtyard, 130 ft by 100 ft, with four galleries each 46 ft wide. The galleries provided accommodation for 280 shops and stall keepers; at the time of its construction it was one of only seven markets in Karachi.\n\nA recreational park called Jahangir Park also is located nearby. In 2017, according to the reports in the news media, Karachi citizens' hopes for seeing a badly needed renovation and repair job on this British Raj building were fading away. The previous Governor of Sindh also had ordered the building's renovation when he was in office, but they never materialized.\n\nEmpress market is one of the places in Karachi where exotic and endangered species like Macaw, Falcons and other birds are sold without any approved license. On 24 August 2015, up to 50 protected birds and a pair of monkey were brought to sell in Empress, when a raid by wildlife department caught the people who brought the animals. The confiscated birds consisted of 20 Chukar partridge, 18 wild doves, eight black partridges, four grey partridges and two flamingoes.\n\nFollowing a Supreme Court order, a major operation was launched in November 2018 to remove more than 1000 shops constructed illegally on land encroached around the market. The resulting clean up restored the visual grandeur of the market although social commentators objected to the destruction of a large number of small businesses some of which had been in existence for more than 50 years.\n\n* Rainbow Centre, Karachi, the largest CD and DVD market in Asia, situated adjacent to the Empress Market.\n\n",

      "description": "Frere Hall (undefined) is a building in Karachi, Pakistan that dates from the early British colonial-era in Sindh. Completed in 1865, Frere Hall was originally intended to serve as Karachi's town hall, and now serves as an exhibition space and library. It is considered one of Karachi's most iconic buildings.\n\nFrere Hall is located in central Karachi's colonial-era Saddar Town, in the Civil Lines neighbourhood that is home to several consulates. The Hall is located between Abdullah Haroon Road (formerly Victoria Road) and Fatima Jinnah Road (formerly Bonus Road). It lies adjacent to the colonial-era Sind Club.\n\nThe building was intended to serve as Karachi's town hall, and was designed by Henry Saint Clair Wilkins, after having been chosen from among 12 possible choices.\n\nThe building's land was purchased at a cost of 2,000 British Indian rupees, which had been donated by WP Andrew of the Scinde Railway, and Sir Frederick Arthur Bartholomew. The total cost of the Hall was about 180,000 rupees, out of which the Government contributed 10,000 rupees, while the rest was paid for by Karachi municipality.\n\nWork commenced in August 1863, and completed in October 1865, though work on the building had not been entirely completed by the time of its inauguration.\n\nIn 1877 at Frere Hall, the first attempt was made to form a consistent set of rules of badminton. Following the death of Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere in 1884, the building was renamed in his honour. Frere was a British administrator who was known for promoting economic development in Sindh, as well as for making the Sindhi Language the language of administration in Sindh, rather than the Persian language which had been favoured by the Mughals.\n\nFollowing the independence of Pakistan, the hall's library was renamed as Liaquat National Library. The library is one of Karachi's largest, and houses a collection of more than 70,000 books, including rare and hand-written manuscripts.\n\nThe hall's ceilings were decorated by the world-renowned Pakistani artist Sadequain in the 1980s, with one mural remaining incomplete after his death in 1987. Several other works by Sadequain are found in the hall, and form what is known as the \"Galerie Sadequain.\"\n\nThe hall was closed periodically between 2002 and 2011 due to numerous attempted terrorist attack on the nearby US consulate, and was not reopened permanently until 2011 when the consulate was relocated to a site further away. It is now directly administered by the Karachi Municipal Corporation, and hosts several festivals.\n\nFrere Hall was built in the Venetian-Gothic style that also blends elements of British architecture with local architectural elements. The building features multiple pointed arches, ribbed vaults, quatrefoils, and flying buttresses. Carving on the walls and beautifully articulated mosaic designs are visible on multiple walls and pillars.\n\nThe building is built primarily out of local yellow-toned limestone, with stone details formed from white oolite stone quarried from the nearby town of Bholari. Red and grey sandstone is also used in the building, which was quarried from the Sindhi town of Jungshahi.\n\nA tall octagonal tower is located in one of the building's corner that is crowned by an iron cage. The roof of the hall is coated with Muntz metal.\n\nThe Hall is surrounded by two lawns originally known as \"Queen's Lawn\" and \"King's Lawn\" which after independence were renamed as Bagh-e-Jinnah, or \"Jinnah Gardens\".\n\nFrere Hall houses a number of stone busts, including that of King Edward VII, which was a gift from local Parsi philanthropist Seth Edulji Dinshaw. Frere Hall also houses oil paintings by Sir Charles Pritchard, who was a former Commissioner of Sindh.\n\nAs of 2018, Frere Hall is still open for public and it is also one of the most important places for tourism not only because of the building's notable architecture, but also for its association with British rule in sub-continent.\n\n\n\n* DAWN.com: \"Frere Hall stands in need of repairs\"",

      "title": "Mohenjo-daro",
      "description": "Mohenjo-daro (موئن جو دڙو, meaning 'Mound of the Dead Men'; undefined ) is an archaeological site in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.\n\nThe city's original name is unknown. Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma (\"the city [-rma] of the cockerel [kukkuta]\"). Cock-fighting may have had ritual and religious significance for the city, with domesticated chickens bred there for sacred purposes, rather than as a food source. Mohenjo-daro may also have been a point of diffusion for the eventual worldwide domestication of chickens.\n\nMohenjo-daro, the modern name for the site, has been variously interpreted as \"Mound of the Dead Men\" in Sindhi, and as \"Mound of Mohan\" (where Mohan is Krishna).\n\nMohenjo-daro is located west of the Indus River in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan, in a central position between the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River. It is situated on a Pleistocene ridge in the middle of the flood plain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 km from the town of Larkana. The ridge was prominent during the time of the Indus Valley Civilization, allowing the city to stand above the surrounding flood, but subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits. The Indus still flows east of the site, but the Ghaggar-Hakra riverbed on the western side is now dry.\n\nMohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE. It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centers at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.\n\nThe ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, an officer of the Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20 identifying what he thought to be a Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Mortimer Wheeler and his trainee, Ahmad Hasan Dani. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. In the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Dr. Michael Jansen and Dr. Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.\n\nMohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan. Most were built of fired and mortared brick; some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden superstructures. The covered area of Mohenjo-daro is estimated at 300 hectares. The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History offers a \"weak\" estimate of a peak population of around 40,000.\n\nThe sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high level of social organization. The city is divided into two parts, the so-called Citadel and the Lower City. The Citadel – a mud-brick mound around 12 m high – is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Waste water was channeled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.\n\nIn 1950, Sir Mortimer Wheeler identified one large building in Mohenjo-daro as a \"Great Granary\". Certain wall-divisions in its massive wooden superstructure appeared to be grain storage-bays, complete with air-ducts to dry the grain. According to Wheeler, carts would have brought grain from the countryside and unloaded them directly into the bays. However, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer noted the complete lack of evidence for grain at the \"granary\", which, he argued, might therefore be better termed a \"Great Hall\" of uncertain function. Close to the \"Great Granary\" is a large and elaborate public bath, sometimes called the Great Bath. From a colonnaded courtyard, steps lead down to the brick-built pool, which was waterproofed by a lining of bitumen. The pool measures 12 m long, 7 m wide and 2.4 m deep. It may have been used for religious purification. Other large buildings include a \"Pillared Hall\", thought to be an assembly hall of some kind, and the so-called \"College Hall\", a complex of buildings comprising 78 rooms, thought to have been a priestly residence.\n\n\n\nMohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, but was fortified with guard towers to the west of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.\n\nThe location of Mohenjo-daro was built in a relatively short period of time, with the water supply system and wells being some of the first planned constructions. With the excavations done so far, over 700 wells are present at Mohenjo-daro, alongside drainage and bathing systems. This number is unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time, such as Egypt or Mesopostamia, and the quantity of wells transcribes as one well for every three houses. Because the large number of wells, it is believed that the inhabitants relied solely on annual rainfall, as well as the Indus River's course remaining close to the site, alongside the wells providing water for long periods of time in the case of the city coming under siege. Due to the period in which these wells were built and used, it is likely that the circular brick well design used at this and many other Harappan sites are an invention that should be credited to the Indus civilization, as there is no existing evidence of this design from Mesopotamia or Egypt at this time, and even later. Sewage and waste water for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the site's streets. These drains that ran alongside the road were effective at allowing most human waste and sewage to be disposed of as the drains tool the waste most likely toward the Indus River. It is theorized that the job of keeping the pipes clean and from getting piled up was either a job for slaves, or captured enemy soldiers, with others who believe it was a paid job for citizens of the city.\n\nThe city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defense against flooding. According to a theory first advanced by Wheeler, the city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times, and later rebuilt in the same location. For some archaeologists, it was believed that a final flood that helped engulf the city in a sea of mud brought about the abandonment of the site. Gregory Possehl was the first to theorize that the floods were caused by overuse and expansion upon the land, and that the mud flood was not the reason the site was abandoned. Instead of a mud flood wiping part of the city out in one fell swoop, Possehl coined the possibility of constant mini-floods throughout the year, paired with the land being worn out by crops, pastures, and resources for bricks and pottery spelled the downfall of the site.\n\nNumerous objects found in excavation include seated and standing figures, copper and stone tools, carved seals, balance-scales and weights, gold and jasper jewellery, and children's toys. Many bronze and copper pieces, such as figurines and bowls, have been recovered from the site, showing that the inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro understood how to utilize the lost wax technique. The furnaces found at the site are believed to have been used for copperworks and melting the metals as opposed to smelting. There even seems to be an entire section of the city dedicated to shell-working, located in the northeastern part of the site. Some of the most prominent copperworks recovered from the site are the copper tablets which have examples of the untranslated Indus script and iconography. While the script has not been cracked yet, many of the images on the tablets match another tablet and both hold the same caption in the Indus language, with the example given showing three tablets with the image of a mountain goat and the inscription on the back reading the same letters for the three tablets. Pottery and terracotta sherds have been recovered from the site, with many of the pots having deposits of ash in them, leading archeologists to believe they were either used to hold the ashes of a person or as a way to warm up a home located in the site. These heaters, or braziers, were ways to heat the house while also being able to be utilized in a manner of cooking or straining, while others solely believe they were used for heating. Many important objects from Mohenjo-daro are conserved at the National Museum of India in Delhi and the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi. In 1939, a representative collection of artefacts excavated at the site was transferred to the British Museum by the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nDiscovered by John Marshall in 1931, the idol appears to mimic certain characteristics that match the Mother Goddess belief common in many early Near East civilizations. Sculptures and figurines depicting women have been observed as part of Harappan culture and religion, as multiple female pieces were recovered from Marshall's archaeological digs. These figures were not categorized correctly, according to Marshall, meaning that where they were recovered from the site is not actually clear. One of said figures, pictured below, is 18.7 cm tall and is currently on display at the National Museum of Pakistan, in Karachi. The fertility and motherhood aspects on display on the idols is represented by the female genitalia that is presented in an almost exaggerated style as stated by Marshall, with him inferring that such figurines are offerings to the goddess, as opposed to the typical understanding of them being idols representing the goddess's likeness. Because of the figurines being unique in terms of hairstyles, body proportions, as well as headdresses and jewelry, there are theories as to who these figurines actually represent. Shereen Ratnagar theorizes that because of their uniqueness and dispersed discovery throughout the site that they could be figurines of ordinary household women, who commissioned these pieces to be used in rituals or healing ceremonies to help aforementioned individual women.\n\n\n\nA bronze statuette dubbed the \"Dancing Girl\", 10.5 cm high and about 4,500 years old, was found in 'HR area' of Mohenjo-daro in 1926; it is now in the National Museum, New Delhi. In 1973, British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler described the item as his favorite statuette: \"She's about fifteen years old I should think, not more, but she stands there with bangles all the way up her arm and nothing else on. A girl perfectly, for the moment, perfectly confident of herself and the world. There's nothing like her, I think, in the world.\"\n\nJohn Marshall, another archeologist at Mohenjo-daro, described the figure as \"a young girl, her hand on her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet.\" The archaeologist Gregory Possehl said of the statuette, \"We may not be certain that she was a dancer, but she was good at what she did and she knew it\". The statue led to two important discoveries about the civilization: first, that they knew metal blending, casting and other sophisticated methods of working with ore, and secondly that entertainment, especially dance, was part of the culture.\n\nIn 1927, a seated male soapstone figure was found in a building with unusually ornamental brickwork and a wall-niche. Though there is no evidence that priests or monarchs ruled Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a \"Priest-King.\" The sculpture is 17.5 cm tall, and shows a neatly bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head, possibly all that is left of a once-elaborate hairstyle or head-dress; his hair is combed back. He wears an armband, and a cloak with drilled trefoil, single circle and double circle motifs, which show traces of red. His eyes might have originally been inlaid.\n\nA seal discovered at the site bears the image of a seated, cross-legged and possibly ithyphallic figure surrounded by animals. The figure has been interpreted by some scholars as a yogi, and by others as a three-headed \"proto-Shiva\" as \"Lord of Animals\".\n\nSir Mortimer Wheeler was especially fascinated with this artifact, which he believed to be at least 4,500 years old. The necklace has an S-shaped clasp with seven strands, each over 4 ft long, of bronze-metal bead-like nuggets which connect each arm of the \"S\" in filigree. Each strand has between 220 and 230 of the many-faceted nuggets, and there are about 1,600 nuggets in total. The necklace weighs about 250 grams in total, and is presently held in a private collection in India.\n\nAn initial agreement to fund restoration was agreed through the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris on 27 May 1980. Contributions were made by a number of other countries to the project:\n\nPreservation work for Mohenjo-daro was suspended in December 1996 after funding from the Pakistani government and international organizations stopped. Site conservation work resumed in April 1997, using funds made available by the UNESCO. The 20-year funding plan provided $10 million to protect the site and standing structures from flooding. In 2011, responsibility for the preservation of the site was transferred to the government of Sindh.\n\nCurrently the site is threatened by groundwater salinity and improper restoration. Many walls have already collapsed, while others are crumbling from the ground up. In 2012, Pakistani archaeologists warned that, without improved conservation measures, the site could disappear by 2030.\n\nThe Mohenjo-daro site was further threatened in January 2014, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People's Party chose the site for Sindh Festival's inauguration ceremony. This would have exposed the site to mechanical operations, including excavation and drilling. Farzand Masih, head of the Department of Archaeology at Punjab University warned that such activity was banned under the Antiquity Act, saying \"You cannot even hammer a nail at an archaeological site.\" On 31 January 2014, a case was filed in the Sindh High Court to bar the Sindh government from continuing with the event. The festival was held by PPP at the historic site, despite all the protest by both national and international historians and educators.\n\n\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of Indus Valley Civilization sites\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * Mehrgarh\n\n\n * Chaudhury, N.

      "title": "Makli Necropolis",
      "description": "Makli Necropolis (undefined; مڪلي جو مقام) is one of the largest funerary sites in the world, spread over an area of 10 square kilometres near the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province of Sindh. The site houses approximately 500,000 to 1 million tombs built over the course of a 400 year period. Makli Necropolis features several large funerary monuments belonging to royalty, various Sufi saints, and esteemed scholars. The site was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 as an \"outstanding testament\" to Sindhi civilization between the 14th and 18th centuries.\n\nMakli Necropolis is located in the town of Makli, which is located on a plateau approximately 6 kilometres from the city of Thatta, the capital of lower Sindh until the 17th century. It lies approximately 98 km east of Karachi, near the apex of the Indus River Delta in southeastern Sindh. The southernmost point of the site is approximately 5 miles north of the ruins of the medieval Kallankot Fort.\n\nThe site, and nearby hills, are said to derive their name from a legend in which a Hajj pilgrim stopped at the site and erupted into spiritual ecstasy, declaring the site to be Makkah for him. The Sufi saint Sheikh Hamad Jamali is then said to have named the site \"Makli\", or \"Little Makkah\", after hearing the story of the pilgrim.\n\nThe Sufi saint, poet and scholar Shaikh Jamali established a khanqah, or Sufi gathering site, at Makli and was eventually buried there. The 14th century Trakhan ruler, Jam Tamachi, venerated the saint and wished to be interred near the saint, beginning the tradition of using Makli as a funerary site.\n\nThe site rose to prominence as a major funerary site during under the rule of the Samma dynasty, who had made their capital near Thatta.\n\nThe most architecturally significant tombs at the site date from around the time of the Mughal era, between 1570 and 1640 CE.\n\nMakli Necropolis occupies 10 square kilometres, housing at least 500,000 tombs. It stretches from Pir Patho at the southern end of the Makli Hills, northward in a roughly diamond shape. Its eastern edge is formed by the Makli Hills ridge. The largest monuments are generally found at the southern edge of the site, though the Samma tombs are found in the north.\n\nThe funerary architecture of the largest monuments synthesizes Muslim, Hindu, Persian, Mughal, and Gujarati influences, in the style of Lower Sindh that became known as the Chaukhandi style, named after the Chaukhandi tombs near Karachi. The Chaukhandi style came to incorporate slabs of sandstone that were carefully carved by stonemasons into intricate and elaborate designs.\n\nThe earliest tombs displayed three to six slabs of stone stacked on top of one another into the shape of a small pyramid. Evolving funerary architecture then incorporated small plinths.\n\nBy the 15th century, decorated rosettes and circular patterns began to be incorporated into the tombs. More complex patterns and Arabic calligraphy with biographical information of the interred body then emerged. Larger monuments dating from later periods included corridors and some designs inspired by cosmology. Pyramidal structures from the 16th century feature the use of minarets topped with floral motifs in a style unique to tombs dating from the Turkic Trakhan dynasty. Structures from the 17th century at the Leilo Sheikh part of the cemetery feature large tombs that resemble Jain temples from afar, with prominent influence from the nearby region of Gujarat.\n\nSeveral of the larger tombs feature carvings of animals, warriors, and weaponry - a practice uncommon to Muslim funerary monuments. Later tombs at the site are sometimes made entirely of brick, with only a sandstone slab.\n\nThe largest structures in the most archetypal Chaukhandi style feature domed yellow sandstone canopies that were plastered white with wooden doorways, in a style that reflects Central Asian and Persian influences. The size of the dome denoted the prominence of the buried individual, with undersides embellished with carved floral patterns. The underside of some canopies feature lotus flowers, a symbol commonly associated with Hinduism.\n\nSome tombs came to feature extensive blue tile-work typical of Sindh. The use of funerary pavilions eventually expanded beyond lower Sindh, and influenced funerary architecture in neighbouring Gujarat.\n\nThe impressive royal mausolea are divided into two major clusters: those from the Samma period form their own cluster, while those from the Tarkhan, Arghun, and Mughals periods are clustered together.\n\nTombs dating from the Samma Dynasty are clustered together in a 5 acre section at the northern end of the necropolis. The Samma were Rajput princes, who seized control of Thatta in 1335. Samma tombs are strongly influenced by Gujarati styles, and incorporate Muslim and Hindu decorative elements.\n\nThe tomb of the King Jam Nizamuddin II, completed in 1510, is an impressive square structure measuring 11.4 metres on each side. It was built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions. The cuboid shape of the tomb may be inspired by the Ka'aba in Makkah. Its dome was never built, thus leaving the interior exposed to the elements. The monument features a large and intricately carved Gujarati-style jharoka, or balcony, and a small peak atop it, which make the tomb resemble a temple. The exterior features 14 bands of decorative motifs that feature both Quranic verses and Hindu symbols, though in keeping with Islamic tradition, all decoration takes the form of geometric patterns, with the sole exception of a frieze depicting local ducks.\n\nThe tomb of Jam Nizamuddin's adoptive son, Darya Khan, resembles a Rajasthani fort, and was built after his death in 1521 Darya Khan had been born a slave, but rose to prominence as a general after defeating an Arghun army in battle. He was granted the title \"Hero of Sindh,\" and was eventually made Madrul Muham, or Prime Minister.\n\nThe tomb of Isa Khan Tarkhan I, who ruled from 1554 to 1565, represents a departure from the funerary architecture of the Sammas. The tomb features a distinctly new cenotaph-style, and is laid out in a rectangular shape with its inner walls entirely covered with Quranic verses. The tomb also has an area dedicated for the graves of 5 of his royal ladies.\n\nThe mausoleum of Isa Khan Hussain II Tarkhan (d. 1651) features a two-story stone building with cupolas and balconies. The tomb is said to have been built during Isa's lifetime. Upon completion, legend states that Isa ordered the hands of the craftsmen to be cut off so that they would not be able to make another monument to rival his own. The tomb of Jan Beg Tarkhan (d. 1600), is an octagonal brick structure whose dome is covered in blue and turquoise glazed tiles. Pavilion or canopy tombs (chattri maqbara or umbrella tomb) are another typical Indo-Islamic architectural feature, as well as enclosure tombs.\n\nThe Mughul period is represented by many tombs on the southern side of the necropolis, including the mausoleum of Mirza Jani and Mirza Ghazi Baig, that of Nawab Shurfa Khan, the enclosure of Mirza Baqi Baig Uzbek and of Mirza Jan Baba as well as the impressive restored tomb of Nawab Isa Khan Tarkhan the Younger.\n\nMakli Necropolis was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. The site's structural integrity has been affected by siltation, encroachment, poor site management, vandalism, and solid waste. The 2010 Pakistan floods further compounded the site's deterioration.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of mausolea\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n\n\n * Oriental Architecture - Makli Necropolis\n * Makli Hill Photo Gallery\n * Illustration of Sind Tiles\n * Ayaz Asif's photo collection of the Makli Hills and the Shah Jahan Mosque.\n * Archnet.org Digital Library (Photographs)\n * Two Monuments on Makli Hill\n * http://www.fotopedia.com/items/4vlcmdk21v1b9-sL5b9ds78r0\n * http://www.fotopedia.com/items/4vlcmdk21v1b9-Rby790BKO18\n * http://www.fotopedia.com/items/4vlcmdk21v1b9-sL5b9ds78r0",

      "title": "Mohatta Palace",
      "description": "The Mohatta Palace (undefined) is a museum located in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. It was built in the posh seaside locale of Clifton by Shivratan Chandraratan Mohatta, a Hindu Marwari businessman from modern day Rajasthan in India, in 1927, as his summer home. The architect of the palace was Agha Ahmed Hussain. However, Mohatta could enjoy this building for only about two decades before independence, after which he left Karachi for India. He built the Palace in the tradition of stone palaces in Rajasthan, using pink Jodhpur stone in combination with the local yellow stone from Gizri. The amalgam gave the palace a distinctive presence in an elegant neighbourhood, characterised by Indo-Saracenic architecture which was located not far from the sea.\n\nThe Mohattas, belonged to the Maheshwari community, originated with Motilal Mohata (spelled Mohatta in English) who migrated in 1842 from Bikaner to Hyderabad (Deccan) and became a clerk in a shop. His four children migrated to Calcutta and became leading merchants of imported cloth. One of them, Govardhan Mohta, settled in Karachi in 1883. His older son, Ramgopal, became a scholar and author (the Hindu Gymkhana, Karachi building was named after him ), and the younger son Shivrattan Dham Payio became an industrialist in Karachi (steel Mill, Sugar Mill etc.) with branches in north India.\n\nThe palace has an area of 18500 sqft and its facade is trimmed with windows, stone brackets, spandrels, domes, balustrades with floral motifs and exquisite railings. There are nine domes, with a centre dome in the middle; while the windows in the front portion opening out into the garden are of blue colour and those in the rear area are arched windows with stained glass. The palace has large stately rooms designed for entertainment on the ground floor and more private facilities on the first floor, where there is a terrace provided with a shade from intense sunlight. The palace is solely made up of teak wood with a polished staircase, long corridors and doors opening within doors. The \"barsati” (terrace) of the Mohatta Palace had a beautiful family temple dedicated to the Hindu God, lord Shiva.\n\nMohatta Palace was a luxurious home built in the late 1920s, consisting of 18,500 sq ft. The elegant palace is built on different levels and was a summer house for the Mohatta family for two decades before they left for India in 1947. There are three levels, basement, ground floor, first floor till you reach the roof. The basement that lies on the north side of the building is quite small and comprises a staircase going downwards towards a hot water pool chamber which has a connected changing room. They say it had a hot and cold water system attached, which would supply the water to the pool. Near the pool chamber are small ventilators, two on each side which may have been used as a source of sunlight and letting out steam.\n\nUpon stepping inside the building is a corridor which connects to each room situated on the ground floor. The ground floor contains large stately rooms designed for entertainment, two towards the right side of the entrance (north), two towards the left (south) and one at the back. The movement inside the building is through the great entrance into a spacious corridor that runs around a huge hall with ornate ceilings and a staircase on the South side.\n\nThere is a large square hall with seven openings leading into a corridor. The hall acts as a datum and around it the corridors are connected to the rooms where different activities are held. On the south between the two rooms is a solid teak wood, polished staircase connecting ground floor and first floor.\n\nOn each corner of the palace are octagonal towers, in which only two near the front entrance have spiral staircases which go up to the roof. At the far end, opposite the entrance is a room for entertainment which has few stairs on each side leading directly into the grounds at the back of the palace.\n\nWhen viewed from outside, the ground floor has two very ornate windows on either side of the entrance consisting of three shutters in each. The same windows are on the north and south side as well, on either side of the stairs which lead from the rooms to the grounds. The octagonal towers have five windows each. In the same way there is a protruding ‘chhajja’ which goes all around the ground floor to provide shade.\n\nThe first floor has private facilities unlike the ground floor. Although this floor also has a large hall in the centre having ten doors which open into the corridor that frames it on two sides (north and south) and private rooms on the other sides (east and west). There are four large bedrooms with attached restrooms and dressing rooms. Each bedroom has two openings, more like ‘doors opening into doors’. The staircase on the south ends on this floor, leaving a passageway to the left which connects to the octagonal tower staircase that leads up to the roof. There is a similar staircase on the opposite end which leads up to the roof. Whereas the remaining two towers remain disconnected, just giving an outdoor view from the windows to each floor.\n\nSimilarly there are windows situated right above the ones on the ground floor giving a view of the vast grounds below. Also there are three openings into the large terrace on the first floor, which overlooks the Arabian Sea. Moreover, the roof top is perhaps the most interesting part of the building, giving an aerial view of the surrounding neighbourhood and the beautiful landscaping done in below.\n\nThe rooftop is connected by staircases coming all the way up from the ground floor, through the frontal north and south octagonal towers. The four octagonal towers are topped by chattris. In the middle of the towers, on both of the north and south side are dainty three portioned, rectangular chattris. Altogether there are nine domes, with a centre dome in the middle and smaller four domes around it. This is slightly elevated and is like a room overlooking the rooftop. It has stairs on the north and south side and the five domes are interconnected.\n\nMohatta Palace is an elaborate building with intricate details which are present in almost every portion of this magnificent building. These are in the form of carvings. The delicate designs include bird’s wings in the large windows, situated in the top right and left corners of the arches.\n\nThere are also peacock motifs in the stonework and they are found around each of the nine domes. Also, there has been a lot of use of the scallop shape in upwards and downward positions around the lower areas, in the form of a strip going around the building and on top of the first and second-floor windows that protrude outwards. There are also many floral motifs around the surrounding wall, between each scallop, such as marigolds. Hibiscus flowers to are found lightly carved between rectangular shapes underneath all the windows, which are on the sides of the doorways.\n\nSimilarly, each window and doorway is framed by two large, intricately carved marigolds at the top right and left side of the arches.\n\nMoreover, the balustrade terrace, rooftop and octagonal towers have dainty knobs and a rectangular box-like shape chiseled into each baluster.\n\nFurthermore, there are decorative brackets underneath each window, projecting ‘chhajja’, entrance ways, domes, all around the building which makes it look more delicate to one's eye. Also, each of the columns around the building has motifs and flowers engraved horizontally between spaces. These go all around the building in a horizontal line.\n\nSimilarly, the five domes of the barsati have lines etched into them, giving them more form and texture, unlike the octagonal towers which are just plain except for the peacock carving which is present in all of the domes.\n\nAfter Mohatta's departure to India, the Government of Pakistan acquired the building to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1947. Fatima Jinnah, the sister of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, moved into it in 1964. In the '60s Mohatta Palace was dubbed Qasre-e-Fatima, becoming the hub of her presidential campaign against President Ayub Khan. After her untimely death, her sister Shireen Jinnah moved in to occupy the ground floor for many years. With her death in 1980, the palace was sealed.\n\nIn 1995 it was purchased by the Government of Sindh for its conversion into a museum devoted to the arts of Pakistan. The Government of Sindh took over ownership of the property and appointed an independent board of trustees headed by the Governor to formulate recommendations on how best to adapt and use the palace. A trust was established to manage the property and ensure that it would not be sold or utilized for commercial or any purpose other than that stipulated in the trust deed. Funds for the acquisition of collections for the museum and the construction of an extension are continuously raised by the trustees through private and public grants, donations, and other fundraising activities. Mohatta Palace Museum formally opened in 1999. Next to the main building can be found a small collection of \"English\" statues which once stood proudly at key public locations in Karachi but flamed public fury during political turmoil in 1960-61. Some statues, notably the ones of Queen Victoria and soldiers of the Raj, were damaged during the turmoil.\n\n\n * Tuesday - Sunday 11.00 am to 6.00 pm\n * Friday Prayer break between 1.00 pm – 3.00 pm\n * Monday closed\n\nThe following public transport is available to the museum.\n * Bus: No 20\n * Minibus: N and W30\n * Coaches: Super Hasan Zai and Khan Coach.\n\n===Exhibitions ===\n\n\n * September 1999: Treasures of the Talpurs.\n * December 1999: Qalam - The Arts of Calligraphy\n * April 2000: Visions of Divinity - The Arts of Gandhara\n * September 2000: Threads in Time - Costumes and Textiles of Pakistan\n * November 2000: Miniature Paintings - A Revival\n * August 2002: Sadequain, The Holy Sinner\n * November 2003: Jamil Naqsh: A Retrospective\n * August 2006: The Tale of the Tile - The Ceramic Tradition of Pakistan\n * 20 March 2010 to 23 June 2010: The Birth of Pakistan hosted by The Citizens Archive of Pakistan\n * 2010 - 2011: The Rising Tide - New directions in the art from Pakistan 1990 - 2010.\n * 18 May 2011 to December 2011: \"Rebel Angel: Asim Butt 1978-2010\"\n * February 2013 to 16 February 2014: Labyrinth of Reflections: The Art of Rashid Rana, 1992-2012\n * May 16, 2014 - Current: Drawing the Line: Rare Maps and Prints\n * July 10, 2015 - Current: A Flower from Every Meadow\n\n*May 8, 2018: Makli - Symphonies in Stone\n\nMakli is one of the six World Heritage Sites located in Pakistan.

An original concept of stone decoration with Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist influences was created at Makli and its remnants survive to this to be admired by local and international visitors.\n\n*October 20, 2017: Imran Mir - Alchemist of Line\n\nBorn in Karachi, Pakistan, in 1950 Imran Mir was an artist, sculptor, designer, and advertising trendsetter. He studied in art schools in Karachi and Toronto and developed a new bold style of his own that initially dumbfounded art critics. But over time, Mir earned the admiration and awe of the art world. His friend and fellow artist Iqbal Geoffrey said about his work: “The pictographs that Imran instills or stirs are novel and enlightening – not parochial, parasitical nor forget-me-not mementos of the picturesque. Love, not logic, is his forte, i.e. metaphysical ménage-a-trios of palette, plate and platform. He trucks mobility, and his mode is poignant – pregnant with pragmatism. Never buttering literalism. Nor brandishing liberalism.\" Mir died in 2014 but his life's work continues to be celebrated.\n\n*February 15, 2017- continuing: Paradise on Earth - Manuscripts, Miniature, and Mendicants of Kashmir\n\nThe title of this majestic exhibition is inspired by the famous quote by Mughal Emporer Jahangir when he visited the valley of Kashmir the first time.

      "title": "Manora Fort, Karachi",
      "description": "\n\nThe Manora Fort or Qasim Fort has been built on Manora Island several times in history to protect the harbour of Karachi. Manora or Manoro or Morontobara is a small peninsula (2.5 km²) located just south of the Port of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.\n\nManora Island was known as Morontobara to the ancient Greeks. The area of Karachi was known to the ancient Greeks by many names: Krokola, the place where Alexander the Great camped to prepare a fleet for Babylonia after his campaign in the Indus valley; 'Morontobara' island (ancient Manora island near Karachi harbour), from where Alexander's admiral Nearchus set sail; and Barbarikon (Βαρβαρικόν), a port of the Indo-Greek Bactrian kingdom. During the rule of the Mughal administrator of Sindh, Mirza Ghazi Beg the city was well fortified the Manora Fort against Portuguese pirate incursions in Sindh. The Manora Island and was visited by Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis and mentioned in his book Mir'ât ül Memâlik in 1554. According to the British historian Eliot, parts of city of Karachi and the island of Manora at port of Karachi constituted the city of Debal.\n\nA small fort was constructed in the 18th century by the Talpur dynasty when the port of Karachi traded with Oman and Bahrain. The fort was stormed by the British in 1839 because of the strategic location of Karachi.\n\nThe Manora fort was stormed by the British in 1839 because of the strategic location of Karachi. On 1 February 1839 a British ship, the Wellesley, anchored off the island of Manora. By 3 February, the fort at Kolachi had surrendered without firing a single shot and this small fishing village reached a turning point in its history. Although the fort is now buried beneath the naval base, the lighthouse is a visible reminder of the British presence having been built in 1889 to assist vessels approaching Karachi harbor.\n\nManora Island and its fort have served for more than 50 years as the main base of the Pakistan Navy, with berths for naval vessels located along the eastern edge of the island. The island has been governed as a military cantonment despite being located so close to Karachi. The opening of the new Jinnah Naval Base at Ormara, 250 kilometers away, has meant that approximately half of the naval vessels have moved away from Manora.\n\n\n * Manora Cantonment\n * Karachi\n * Pakistan Navy\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n\n\n * Manora Fort, Karachi\n * Manora Fort Photo\n\n",

      "title": "Ranikot Fort",
      "description": "Ranikot Fort (رني ڪوٽ, undefined) (also known as Rannikot) is a historical Talpur fort near Sann, Jamshoro District, Sindh, Pakistan. Ranikot Fort is also known as The Great Wall of Sindh and is believed to be the world's largest fort, with a circumference of approximately 32 km. The fort's ramparts have been compared to the Great Wall of China.\n\nThe site was nominated in 1993 by the Pakistan National Commission for UNESCO world heritage status, and has since been on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The fort is listed as a historical site under the Antiquities Act, 1975 and its subsequent amendments, and is provided protection.\n\nRanikot Fort is 90 km to the north of Hyderabad on the national highway. There is also an easy access of about an hour's journey from Karachi to Sann on the Indus Highway. A diversion road, starting a little distance away from Sann, the nearest town, leads to the fort along a rugged 21 km road and reaches the eastern gate of the fort, known as Sann Gate. Sann is a rail head on the Kotri-Larkana line of the Pakistan Railway. It is inside the Kirthar National Park, the second largest national park in Pakistan.\n\nThe original purpose and architects of Ranikot Fort are unknown. It was formerly believed that the fort was built during the regimes of the Sassanians, the Scythians, the Parthians or the Bactrian Greeks, however, more recent evidence shows that the fort originated under the Talpurs.\n\nArchaeologists point to the 17th century as the time of its first construction but Sindh archaeologists now agree that some of the present structures were reconstructed by Talpurs in 1812 at a cost of 1.2 million rupees (Sindh Gazetteer, 677). The battlements of Ranikot formed the last capital of the Amirs of Sind, when they were brought under the colonial rule of the British Empire. Radiocarbon tests were conducted at the Sann Gate on the charcoal embedded in the mortar of a collapsed pillar of the eastern gate of the fort. These tests have confirmed that this gate was probably renovated between the early part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century, prior to Britain invading the fort when the Kalhoras, or most likely the Talpur Mirs of Sindh ruled over the area.\n\nThe fort is huge, connecting several bleak mountains of the Kirthar hills along contours, and measures 31 km in length. The fort's wall is interspersed with several bastions, and three are of semi-circular shape. The northern part of the fort's perimeter is a natural high hilly formation while on the other three sides it is covered by fort walls. Within this main fort there is a smaller fort known as the \"Miri Fort\" which is about 3 km from the Sann gate, and is reported to have served as the palace of the Mir royal family. The entire fort structure has been built with stone and lime mortar. The fort is built in a zig-zag form, with four entry gates in the shape of a rhomboid. The four gates are namely: Sann Gate, Amri Gate, Shah-Pere Gate and Mohan Gate. Two of the gates, facing each are crossed diagonally by the Sann river; the first gate is on the western side and is skirted by the river water and is difficult to approach. The southern entry gate has a double doors gate. Within the gates there are two niches which have floral ornamentation and carved stones. The Sann gate is well preserved and can be climbed to reach the top of the fort from both sides to get a scenic view of the terrain around the fort. This gate is also the entrance to the Meeri.\n\nRestoration works were undertaken on the fort, particularly on the Sann Gate complex, the fortification wall extending south including the mosque and the small Meeri fort or palace within the main fort. These were undertaken by the Archaeology department of Pakistan, the Department of Culture of Sindh and the Dadu district administration. Following allegations of poor construction and favoritism in award of contracts an enquiry was instituted in 2005. The Enquiry Commission's report indicated that the restoration works were poorly done with cement and new stone work without conforming to the \"Venice Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites\" and recommended stoppage of further work on the fort. Based on this report further restoration work was suspended in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n\n*\n\n* Ranikot Fort – The Great Wall of Pakistan – also Known as the Mysterious Place in Pakistan\n * Ranikot Fort – The Great Wall of Pakistan – also Known as the Mysterious Place in Pakistan",

      "description": "Umarkot Fort (undefined; Sindhi:  عمر ڪوٽ جو قلعو ), is a fort located in Umerkot, Sindh, also called Amarkot (undefined; Sindhi: امرڪوٽ ), Emperor Akbar was born in Umarkot Fort when his father Humayun fled from the military defeats at the hands of Sher Shah Suri on 15 October 1542. Rana Parasad of Umarkot, who had risen to power had given refuge to Mughal Emperor Humayun and it was there Hamida Bano Begum gave birth to young Akbar. Later the Mughal Emperor Akbar became the Shahenshah of Hindustan and was a popular figure with both Hindus and Muslims. Umerkot has many sites of historical significance such as Mughal emperor Akbar's birthplace near to Umarkot Fort, currently King Akbar birth place is an open land. In 1746, the Mughal Subahdar, Noor Mohammad Kalhoro, built a fort at the location. Later the British would take over that area.\n\nAmarkot fort was built by Rana Amar Singh in 11th century. It remained under control of Hindu Rajput dynasty known as the Ranas of Umerkot, but later was taken over by the Pakistani Government after formation of Pakistan. However, Rana family still have their jagir located 16 km away. The governorship of fort was possessed by Rana Megraj.\n\nAnother significant story relating to Umarkot is that of Umar Marvi. Marvi was a young Thari girl abducted by Umar, the then ruler, who wanted to marry because of her beauty. Upon her refusal, she was imprisoned in the historic Umerkot Fort for many years until her ultimate release. Because of her courage, Marvi is an ideal for the local people.\n\n\n * List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Pakistan\n * List of forts in Pakistan\n * List of museums in Pakistan\n * Umerkot\n\n",

      "description": "The Kirthar Mountains (كوه کھیرتھر) (کير ٿر جبل) are a mountain range located in the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. The mountains extend southward for about 190 mi from the Mula River in east-central Balochistan to Cape Monze on the Arabian Sea. The Kirthar Mountains form the boundary between the lower Indus Plain (to the east) and southern Balochistan (to the west). It consists of a series of parallel rock hill ridges rising from 4000 ft in the south to nearly 8000 ft in the north.\n\nThe maximum elevation in the Sindh segment of the mountains was reported in April 2009, as 7056 ft above sea-level. An old map, by the British Army Corps of Engineers, calls it Barugh Hill, along with a surveyed height of 7122 ft. Barugh, means \"big fat mountain\" in the Brahui language, the language of the Sasoli tribe, who still live in that area. Barough is a branch of the Kirthar mountains, off Dadu, and the highest mountain peak of Sindh, situated a few miles north-west of the upcoming Gorakh Hill Station, at 5688 ft from sea level. The next highest is a 6880 ft peak, known locally as Kutte-Ji-Kabar (Dog's Grave) which is placed in Darhiyaro Balochistan. There are also a number of other peaks in the Sindh segment of the Kirthar Mountains exceeding 5500 ft; these all receive occasional snowfall during the winter rains.\n\nAccording to Balochistan 1907 Volume VI-B Jhalawan, this area belongs to Balochistan. That, from the top of the Kuchak-na-Kabar (6,878 fed) which rises from the high table-land of Darhiyaro., a good view of the surrounding country is obtained, the hills beyond the valley of Karkh or Karu being visible, as well as the verdant bed of the Gaaj river. Another important peak is Andraj (6,4')6 feet to the south-east of Zidi. To the south the mountains decrease in size, the Bedor hill, not however situated in the Jhalawan, being only 3,320 feet above sea level. There are a good many passes in the range which are passable by camels, but the only ones which are much used are the Gaji Lak on the road from Zidi and Khuzdar to Jhalawan. The history also said the land of Darhiyaro. belongs to Chhutta tribe.\n\nRegarding the communities which are and were settled in Darhiyaro they wrote \"Dr. J. Ph. Vogel published in 1905 an interesting note on the Ancienttombs at Hin£dan in Las Bela. Attention to these tombs was first drawn by Major M.A. Tighe, Political Agent in Southern Baluchistan, and the locality was subsequently visited by Dr. Vogel Binfdan. The tombs, 71 in number, are situated in the area of the Chhuttas and the local tradition ascribes the origin of the place to Chhutto and Jakharas, now settled in Sindh, who are a subdivision of the Burfat tribe, which is believed to be of Rajput origin.\"\n\nKirthar has a simple mountain structure of the regular anticlinal type, with the arches steepest towards the north and the west and gently dipping towards the south and the valley of the Darhiyaro. The inhabitants of the Kirthar Mountains are chiefly Chhutto people of Bhootani tribe, Sindhi and Balochi tribes, on both sides, who subsist by flock grazing. Major Baloch tribes of Kirthar are Chhutta, Burfat, Gabol, Marri, Bozdar, Lund, Nohani, Bugti, Chandio, Lashari, and others.\n\n\n\n\n * List of mountain ranges of Pakistan\n * List of mountains in Pakistan\n * Bado Hill Station\n\n* Photos from Kirthar at offroadpakistan.com",

      "description": "Karoonjhar Mountains (undefined) are located in Tharparkar, Sindh, Pakistan. It is approximately 19 km in length and attains a height of 305 m\n\nThis is the only hill in the district near Nagarparkar on the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch. It consists of granite rocks, probably an outlying mass of the crystalline rocks of the Aravalli range. The Aravalli series belongs to Archaen system which constitutes the oldest rocks of the Earth's crust and Chinese clay. This is a small area quite different from the desert. The tract is flat and level except close to Nagarparkar itself. The principal range, Karunjhir, is approximately 19 km in length and attains a height of 305 m. Smaller hills rise in the east, which are covered with sparse jungle and pasturage and give rise to two perennial springs named Achleshwar and Sardharo as well as temporary streams called Bhetiani and Gordhro, after the rains.\n\nKaroonjhar Dam is being constructed to supply water to people of Nagarparkar area. In monsoon season, the rain water pours down from the mountain and flows in more than twenty streams, Bhatiani, Maoo, Gordaro, Ranaser, Sukhpur, Ghatiari, Madanwah, Moondaro, Bhodeser, Lolrai, Drah, Puranwah to the Rann of Kutch. The climate of this mountain range is extreme due to rocky terrain, August and September are only cool months due to monsoon.\n\nKaroonjhar has economic significance for the local people of the area, it is rich in deposits and plant medicinal values. These plants include shatavari, okra and wild onion. This mountain is economically so significant that there is a local saying \"Karoonjhar yields a hundred kilos of gold regularly.\".\n\nKaroonjhar has been mentioned in many verses of Sindhi and Gujarati poets. Myths and lores of Sadwant & Sharanga, Hothlal Pari (nature's fairy), Odho Jam (Sindhi lore) and Bherio Garori (wolf's ring) are regarded to this range. Hothlal Pari is considered to have had appeared 1st in the Karoonjhar mountains. In old times, Karoonjhar was also famously known as \"Kinro\". The mountain range has several places of historical importance, like Bhodeser Talao, Alakh Wao (hidden well), Anchlechure, Sardaro, Gao Mukhi, Punraj Gadr, Nani, Chandan gadr, Bhaun jo bheesro, Jharno and Bhaunro. In the past, many individuals were exiled to the Karoonjhar by monarchs of nearby states.\n\n",

The Hill station attracts thousands of tourists from the city.\n\nThe name Gorakh is derived from the Sindhi language in which, word \"Gorakhnath\" refers to a popular Hindu preacher associated with the deity Shiva and that Balochi-language word \"Gurkh\" is later dialectic adaptation of Sindhi-language word Gorakh.\n\nDifferent opinions have been given about the history and origin of the hill station. It is said that the medieval Hindu saint, Gorakhnath, had extensively wandered in hills and the region. According to Nandu, an authority on Sanskrit, Gorakh is a Sanskrit word which means \"shepherding of sheep, cow and goat, etc.\"\n\nGorakh Hill Station is situated on one of the highest plateaus of Sindh, spread over 2500 acre of land. It is very attractive to nature lovers owing to its temperate weather and beautiful surroundings.\n\nGorakh Hill Station is famous for its nightlife, specially Bonfire setup.\n\nGorakh's elevation gives it a special climate, with sub-zero temperatures during winter and generally below 20 C in summer, with about 120 mm of average annual rainfall. The Government of Sindh is in the process of constructing a new road from Dadu to Gorakh Hill. There is a new rest house for visitors on the hill.

      "title": "Lake",
      "description": "\n\nA lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.\n\nNatural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n\nMany lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, or for aesthetic, recreational purposes, or other activities.\n\n\n\nThe word lake comes from Middle English lake (\"lake, pond, waterway\"), from Old English lacu (\"pond, pool, stream\"), from Proto-Germanic *lakō (\"pond, ditch, slow moving stream\"), from the Proto-Indo-European root *leǵ- (\"to leak, drain\"). Cognates include Dutch laak (\"lake, pond, ditch\"), Middle Low German lāke (\"water pooled in a riverbed, puddle\") as in: de:Wolfslake, de:Butterlake, German Lache (\"pool, puddle\"), and Icelandic lækur (\"slow flowing stream\"). Also related are the English words leak and leach.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty about defining the difference between lakes and ponds, and no current internationally accepted definition of either term across scientific disciplines or political boundaries exists. For example, limnologists have defined lakes as water bodies which are simply a larger version of a pond, which can have wave action on the shoreline or where wind-induced turbulence plays a major role in mixing the water column. None of these definitions completely excludes ponds and all are difficult to measure. For this reason, simple size-based definitions are increasingly used to separate ponds and lakes. Definitions for lake range in minimum sizes for a body of water from 2 ha to 8 ha (see also the definition of \"pond\"). Charles Elton, one of the founders of ecology, regarded lakes as waterbodies of 40 ha or more. The term lake is also used to describe a feature such as Lake Eyre, which is a dry basin most of the time but may become filled under seasonal conditions of heavy rainfall. In common usage, many lakes bear names ending with the word pond, and a lesser number of names ending with lake are in quasi-technical fact, ponds. One textbook illustrates this point with the following: \"In Newfoundland, for example, almost every lake is called a pond, whereas in Wisconsin, almost every pond is called a lake.\"\n\nOne hydrology book proposes to define the term \"lake\" as a body of water with the following five characteristics:\n * it partially or totally fills one or several basins connected by straits\n * has essentially the same water level in all parts (except for relatively short-lived variations caused by wind, varying ice cover, large inflows, etc.)\n * it does not have regular intrusion of seawater\n * a considerable portion of the sediment suspended in the water is captured by the basins (for this to happen they need to have a sufficiently small inflow-to-volume ratio)\n * the area measured at the mean water level exceeds an arbitrarily chosen threshold (for instance, one hectare)\n\nWith the exception of the seawater intrusion criterion, the others have been accepted or elaborated upon by other hydrology publications.\n\n\n\nThe majority of lakes on Earth are freshwater, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, with a deranged drainage system, has an estimated 31,752 lakes larger than 3 km² and an unknown total number of lakes, but is estimated to be at least 2 million. Finland has 187,888 lakes 500 m² or larger, of which 56,000 are large (10000 m² or larger).\n\nMost lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake's average level by allowing the drainage of excess water. Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic lakes.\n\nMany lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydro-electric power generation, aesthetic purposes, recreational purposes, industrial use, agricultural use or domestic water supply.\n\nEvidence of extraterrestrial lakes exists; \"definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane\" was announced by NASA as returned by the Cassini Probe observing the moon Titan, which orbited the planet Saturn.\n\nGlobally, lakes are greatly outnumbered by ponds: of an estimated 304 million standing water bodies worldwide, 91% are 1 ha or less in area (see definition of ponds). Small lakes are also much more numerous than large lakes: in terms of area, one-third of the world's standing water is represented by lakes and ponds of 10 ha or less. However, large lakes account for much of the area of standing water with 122 large lakes of 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi, 100,000 ha, 247,000 acres) or more representing about 29% of the total global area of standing inland water.\n\nIn 1957, Hutchinson published a monograph that is regarded as a landmark discussion and classification of all major lake types, their origin, morphometric characteristics, and distribution. As summarized and discussed by these researchers, Hutchinson presented in it a comprehensive analysis of the origin of lakes and proposed what is a widely accepted classification of lakes according to their origin. This classification recognizes 11 major lake types that are divided into 76 subtypes. The 11 major lake types are tectonic lakes, volcanic lakes, landslide lakes, glacial lakes, solution lakes, fluvial lakes, aeolian lakes, shoreline lakes, organic lakes, anthropomorphic lakes, and meteorite (extraterrestrial impact) lakes.\n\nTectonic lakes are lakes formed by the deformation and resulting lateral and vertical movements of the Earth's crust. These movements include faulting, tilting, folding, and warping. Some of the well-known and largest lakes on Earth are rift lakes occupying rift valleys, e.g. Central African Rift lakes and Lake Baikal. Other well-known tectonic lakes, Caspian Sea, the Sea of Aral, and other lakes from the Pontocaspian occupy basins that have been separated from the sea by the tectonic uplift of the sea floor above sea level.\n\nOften, the tectonic action of crustal extension has created an alternating series of parallel grabens and horsts that form elongate basins alternating with mountain ranges. Not only does this promote the creation of lakes by the disruption of preexisting drainage networks, it also creates within arid regions endorheic basins that containing salt lakes (also called saline lakes). They form where there is no natural outlet, a high evaporation rate and the drainage surface of the water table has a higher-than-normal salt content. Examples of these salt lakes include Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Another type of tectonic lake caused by faulting is sag ponds.\n\nVolcanic lakes are lakes that occupy either local depressions, e.g. craters and maars or larger basins, e.g. calderas, created by volcanism. Crater lakes are formed in volcanic craters and calderas, which fill up with precipitation more rapidly than they empty via either evaporation, groundwater discharge, or combination of both. Sometimes the latter are called caldera lakes, although often no distinction is made. An example is Crater Lake in Oregon, in the caldera of Mount Mazama. The caldera was created in a massive volcanic eruption that led to the subsidence of Mount Mazama around 4860 BCE. Other volcanic lakes are created when either rivers or streams are dammed by lava flows or volcanic lahars. The basin which is now Malheur Lake, Oregon was created when a lava flow dammed the Malheur River.\n\nGlacial lakes are lakes created by the direct action of glaciers and continental ice sheets. A wide variety of glacial processes create enclosed basins. As a result, there are a wide variety of different types of glacial lakes and it is often difficult to define clear-cut distinctions between different types of glacial lakes and lakes influenced by other activities. The general types of glacial lakes that have recognized are lakes in direct contact with ice; glacially carved rock basins and depressions; morainic and outwash lakes; and glacial drift basins. Glacial lakes are the most numerous lakes in the world. Most lakes in northern Europe and North America have been either influenced or created by the latest, but not last, glaciation, to have covered the region. Glacial lakes include proglacial lakes, subglacial lakes, finger lakes, and epishelf lakes. Epishelf lakes are highly stratified lakes in which a layer of freshwater, derived from ice and snow melt, is dammed behind an ice shelf that is attached to the coastline. They are mostly found in Antarctica.\n\nFluvial (or riverine) lakes are lakes produced by running water. These lakes include plunge pool lakes, fluviatile dams and meander lakes.\n\nThe most common type of fluvial lake is a crescent-shaped lake called an oxbow lake due to the distinctive curved shape. They can form in river valleys as a result of meandering. The slow-moving river forms a sinuous shape as the outer side of bends are eroded away more rapidly than the inner side. Eventually a horseshoe bend is formed and the river cuts through the narrow neck. This new passage then forms the main passage for the river and the ends of the bend become silted up, thus forming a bow-shaped lake.\n\nThese form where sediment from a tributary blocks the main river.\n\nThese form where sediment from the main river blocks a tributary, usually in the form of a levee.\n\nA solution lake is a lake occupying a basin formed by surface dissolution of bedrock. In areas underlain by soluble bedrock, its solution by precipitation and percolating water commonly produce cavities. These cavities frequently collapse to form sinkholes that form part of the local karst topography. Where groundwater lies near the grounds surface, a sinkhole will be filled water as a solution lake. If such a lake consists of a large area of standing water that occupies an extensive closed depression in limestone, it is also called a karst lake. Smaller solution lakes that consist of a body of standing water in a closed depression within a karst region are known as karst ponds. Limestone caves often contain pools of standing water, which are known as underground lakes. Classic examples of solution lakes are abundant in the karst regions at the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and within large parts of Florida.\n\nLandslide lakes are lakes created by the blockage of a valley by either mudflows, rockslides, or screes. Such lakes are common in mountainous regions. Although landslide lakes may be large and quite deep, they are typically short-lived. An example of a landslide lake is Quake Lake, which formed as a result of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.\n\nAeolian lakes are lakes produced by wind action. They are found mainly in arid environments although some aeolian lakes are relict landforms indicative of arid paleoclimates. Aeolian lakes consist of lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand; interdunal lakes that lies between well-oriented sand dunes; and deflation basins formed by wind action under previously arid paleoenvironments. Moses Lake, Washington, is an example of a lake basins dammed by wind-blown sand.\n\nShoreline lakes are generally lakes created by blockage of estuaries or by the uneven accretion of beach ridges by longshore and other currents. They include maritime coastal lakes, ordinarily in drowned estuaries; lakes enclosed by two tombolos or spits connecting an island to the mainland; lakes cut off from larger lakes by a bar; or lakes divided by the meeting of two spits.\n\nOrganic lakes are lakes created by the actions of plants and animals. On the whole they are relatively rare in occurrence and quite small in size. In addition, they typically ephemeral features relative to the other types of lakes. The basins in which organic lakes occur are associated with beaver dams, coral lakes, or dams formed by vegetation.\n\nPeat lakes are a form of organic lake. They form where a buildup of partly decomposed plant material in a wet environment leaves the vegetated surface below the water table for a sustained period of time. They are often low in nutrients and mildly acidic, with bottom waters low in dissolved oxygen.\n\nAnthropogenic lakes are artificially created lakes formed by human activity. They can be the result of intentional damming of rivers and streams or subsequent filling of abandoned excavations by either ground water, precipitation, or a combination of both.\n\nMeteorite lakes, which are also known as crater lakes, are lakes created by catastrophic extraterrestrial impacts by either meteorites or asteroids. Examples of meteorite lakes are Lonar crater lake, India, Lake Elgygytgyn, and Pingualuit crater lake, Quebec, Canada, As in case of Lake El'gygytgyn and Pingualuit crater lake, meteorite (extraterrestrial impact/ crater) lakes can contain unique and scientifically valuable sedimentary deposits associated with long records of paleoclimatic changes.\n\n\n\nIn addition to mode of origin, lakes have been named and classified in various other ways according to their thermal stratification, salinity, relative seasonal permanence, degree of outflow, and other factors. Also, different cultures and regional of the world have their popular nomenclature\n\nIn addition to their origin, there are various other ways of either naming or defining types of lakes. One major way of classification lakes in on the basis of thermal stratification because it is a major control on animal and plant life inhabiting a lake and the fate and distribution of dissolved and suspended material in a lake. For example, the thermal stratification and the degree and frequency of mixing exerts a strong control on the distribution of oxygen within it. In addition, lake can be classified according important factors such as seasonal variations in lake volume and level, oxygen saturation, and salinity of its water mass. Finally, the names of types of lakes that are used by the lay public and in the scientific for different types of lakes are often informally derived from either from their morphology of other aspects or their physical characteristics.\n\nF.A. Forel, who is also referred to as the father of limnology, was the first scientist to classify lakes according to their thermal stratification. His system of classification was later modified and improved upon by Hutchinson and Laffler. Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the epilimnion. However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.\n\nBased upon thermal stratification, lakes are classified as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix. The deepest layer of water in such a lake does not contain any dissolved oxygen. In addition, the layers of sediment at the bottom of a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, dimictic lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.\n\nThe stratification in a lake is not always the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated not by a thermocline but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.\n\nLakes are informally classified and named according to the seasonal variation in their lake level and volume. Some of the names include:\n * Ephemeral lake is a short-lived lake or pond. If it fills with water and dries up (disappears) seasonally it is known as an intermittent lake They often fill poljes\n * Dry lake is a popular name for an ephemeral lake that contains water only intermediately at irregular and infrequent intervals.\n * Perennial lake is a lake that has water in its basin throughout the year and is not subject to extreme fluctuations in level.\n * Playa lake is a typically shallow, intermittent lake that covers or occupies a playa either in wet seasons or in especially wet years but subsequently drying up in an arid or semiarid region.\n * Vlei is a name used in South Africa for a shallow lake which varies considerably in level with the seasons.\n\nLakes are also informally classified and named according to the general chemistry of their water mass. Some of the types of lakes include:\n * An acid lake is a lake that has a pH is below neutral (<6.5). A lake is considered highly acidic when the pH drops below 5.5, below which when biological consequences occur. Such lakes include acid pit lakes occupying abandoned mines and excavations; naturally acid lakes of igneous and metamorphic landscapes; peat bogs in northern regions; acid-saline lakes of arid environments; crater lakes of active and dormant volcanoes; and lakes acidified by acid rain.\n * A salt lake, which also known as a brine lake, is an inland body of water situated in an arid or semiarid region, having no outlet to the sea, and containing a high concentration of dissolved salts (principally sodium chloride). Examples include the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and the Dead Sea in the Near East.\n * alkali sink, also known as salt flats, are lakes on the other extreme of the scale from the large and deep saline lakes. They are, shallow saline features that occupy low-lying areas of the arid regions and in groundwater discharge zones. These are typically classifiable as either playas or playa lakes because they are periodically flooded by either rain or flood events and then dry up during drier intervals, leaving accumulations of brines and evaporitic minerals.\n * A salt pan (saltpan) is either an undrained small shallow natural depression in which water accumulates and evaporates leaving a salt deposit or the shallow lake of brackish water occupying a salt pan. This term is also used for a large pan for recovering salt by evaporation.\n * A saline pan is a name for an ephemeral saline lake which precipitates a bottom crust that is subsequently modified during subaerial exposure.\n\n\n * Lava lake is a large volume of molten lava, usually basaltic, contained in a volcanic vent, crater, or broad depression.\n * Hydrocarbon lakes are bodies of liquid ethane and methane that occupy depressions on the surface of Titan. They were detected by the Cassini–Huygens space probe.\n\nA paleolake, also spelt palaeolake, is a lake that existed in the past when hydrological conditions were different. Quaternary paleolakes can often be identified on the basis of relict lacustrine landforms such as relict lake plains and coastal landforms that form recognizable relict shorelines, which are called paleoshorelines. Paleolakes can also be recognized by characteristic sedimentary deposits that accumulated in them and any fossils that these sediments might contain. The paleoshorelines and sedimentary deposits of paleolakes provide evidence for prehistoric hydrological changes during the times that they existed.\n\nTypes of paleolakes include:\n * A is a lake which is no longer in existence. Such lakes include prehistoric lakes and lakes which have permanently dried up often as the result of either evaporation or human intervention. Owens Lake in California, USA, is an example of a former lake. Former lakes are a common feature of the Basin and Range area of southwestern North America.\n * A shrunken lake is a lake which has drastically decreased in size over geological time. Lake Agassiz, which once covered much of central North America, is a good example of a shrunken lake. Two notable remnants of this lake are Lake Winnipeg and Lake Winnipegosis.\n\nPaleolakes are of scientific and economic importance. For example, Quaternary paleolakes in semidesert basins are important for two reasons. First, they played an extremely significant, if transient, role in shaping the floors and piedmonts of many basins. Finally, their sediments contain enormous quantities of geologic and paleontologic information concerning past environments. In addition, the organic-rich deposits of pre-Quaternary paleolakes are important either for the thick deposits of oil shale and shale gas that they contain or as source rocks of petroleum and natural gas. Although of significantly less economic importance, strata deposited along the shore of paleolakes sometimes contain coal seams.\n\nLakes have numerous features in addition to lake type, such as drainage basin (also known as catchment area), inflow and outflow, nutrient content, dissolved oxygen, pollutants, pH, and sedimentation.\n\nChanges in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake. Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake, runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake's catchment area, groundwater channels and aquifers, and artificial sources from outside the catchment area. Output sources are evaporation from the lake, surface and groundwater flows, and any extraction of lake water by humans. As climate conditions and human water requirements vary, these will create fluctuations in the lake level.\n\nLakes can be also categorized on the basis of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. Mesotrophic lakes have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.\n\nDue to the unusual relationship between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 °F) at sea level. When the temperature of the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain a reservoir of cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling.\n\nSince the surface water of deep tropical lakes never reaches the temperature of maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if there is even a trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water at the bottom of the lake. This is called a limnic eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces it, so it may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation.\n\nThe material at the bottom of a lake, or lake bed, may be composed of a wide variety of inorganics, such as silt or sand, and organic material, such as decaying plant or animal matter. The composition of the lake bed has a significant impact on the flora and fauna found within the lake's environs by contributing to the amounts and the types of nutrients available.\n\nA paired (black and white) layer of the varved lake sediments correspond to a year. During winter, when organisms die, carbon is deposited down, resulting to a black layer. At the same year, during summer, only few organic materials are deposited, resulting to a white layer at the lake bed. These are commonly used to track past paleontological events.\n\nNatural lakes provide a microcosm of living and nonliving elements that are relatively independent of their surrounding environments. Therefore, lake organisms can often be studied in isolation from the lake's surroundings.\n\n\n\nLimnology is the study of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the littoral zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of suspended particles. A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8 in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.\n\nA lake moderates the surrounding region's temperature and climate because water has a very high specific heat capacity (4,186 J·kg −1 ·K −1 ). In the daytime a lake can cool the land beside it with local winds, resulting in a sea breeze; in the night it can warm it with a land breeze.\n\nThe lake may be infilled with deposited sediment and gradually become a wetland such as a swamp or marsh. Large water plants, typically reeds, accelerate this closing process significantly because they partially decompose to form peat soils that fill the shallows. Conversely, peat soils in a marsh can naturally burn and reverse this process to recreate a shallow lake resulting in a dynamic equilibrium between marsh and lake. This is significant since wildfire has been largely suppressed in the developed world over the past century. This has artificially converted many shallow lakes into emergent marshes. Turbid lakes and lakes with many plant-eating fish tend to disappear more slowly. A \"disappearing\" lake (barely noticeable on a human timescale) typically has extensive plant mats at the water's edge. These become a new habitat for other plants, like peat moss when conditions are right, and animals, many of which are very rare (example?). Gradually the lake closes and young peat may form, forming a fen. In lowland river valleys where a river can meander, the presence of peat is explained by the infilling of historical oxbow lakes. In the very last stages of succession, trees can grow in, eventually turning the wetland into a forest.\n\nSome lakes can disappear seasonally. These are called intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes and can be found in karstic terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graubünden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.\n\nSometimes a lake will disappear quickly. On 3 June 2005, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, a lake called Lake Beloye vanished in a matter of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that this strange phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River.\n\nThe presence of ground permafrost is important to the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science (\"Disappearing Arctic Lakes\", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.\n\nSome lakes disappear because of human development factors. The shrinking Aral Sea is described as being \"murdered\" by the diversion for irrigation of the rivers feeding it.\n\n\n\nOnly one world other than Earth is known to harbor large lakes, Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Photographs and spectroscopic analysis by the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft show liquid ethane on the surface, which is thought to be mixed with liquid methane. The largest Titanean lake, Kraken Mare at 400,000 km 2, is three-times the size of any lake on Earth, and even the second, Ligeia Mare, is estimated to be slightly larger than Earth's Lake Michigan–Huron.\n\nJupiter's large moon Io is volcanically active, and as a result sulfur deposits have accumulated on the surface. Some photographs taken during the Galileo mission appear to show lakes of liquid sulfur in volcanic caldera, though these are more analogous to lake of lava than of water on Earth.\n\nThe planet Mars has only one confirmed lake; it is underground and near the south pole. However, the surface of Mars is too cold and has too little atmospheric pressure to permit permanent surface water. Geologic evidence appears to confirm, however, that ancient lakes once formed on the surface. It is also possible that volcanic activity on Mars will occasionally melt subsurface ice, creating large temporary lakes. This water would quickly freeze and then sublimate, unless insulated in some manner, such as by a coating of volcanic ash.\n\nThere are dark basaltic plains on the Moon, similar to lunar maria but smaller, that are called lacus (singular lacus, Latin for \"lake\") because they were thought by early astronomers to be lakes of water.\n\nIt is also the world's largest freshwater lake by volume (23600 km³, but much smaller than the Caspian Sea at 78200 km³), and the second longest (about 630 km from tip to tip). The world's oldest lake is again, Lake Baikal, followed by Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania. Lake Maracaibo is considered by some to be the second-oldest lake on Earth, but since it lies at sea level and nowadays is a contiguous body of water with the sea, others consider that it has turned into a small bay. * The longest lake is Lake Tanganyika, with a length of about 660 km (measured along the lake's center line). It is also the third largest by volume, the second oldest, and the second deepest (1470 m) in the world, after Lake Baikal. * The northernmost named lake on Earth is Upper Dumbell Lake in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada at a latitude of 82°28'N. It is 5.2 km southwest of Alert, the northernmost settlement in the world. There are also several small lakes north of Upper Dumbell Lake, but they are all unnamed and only appear on very detailed maps.\n * The largest lake by surface area is Caspian Sea, which is despite its name considered as a lake from the point of view of geography. Its surface area is 143,000 sq. mi./371,000 km 2.\n * The second largest lake by surface area, and the largest freshwater lake by surface area, is Lake Michigan-Huron, which is hydrologically a single lake. Its surface area is 45,300 sq. mi./117,400 km 2 . For those who consider Lake Michigan-Huron to be separate lakes, and Caspian Sea to be a sea, Lake Superior would be the largest lake at 82,100 km 2 (31,700 square miles)\n * Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world, located in Siberia, with a bottom at 1637 m. Its mean depth is also the greatest in the world (749 m).\n * The world's highest lake, if size is not a criterion, may be the crater lake of Ojos del Salado, at 6390 m.\n * The highest large (greater than 250 km2) lake in the world is the 290 km2 Pumoyong Tso (Pumuoyong Tso), in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, at 28-34N 90-24E, 5,018 m above sea level.\n * The world's highest commercially navigable lake is Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia at 3812 m. It is also the largest lake in South America.\n * The world's lowest lake is the Dead Sea, bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west, at 418 m below sea level. It is also one of the lakes with highest salt concentration.\n * Lake Michigan–Huron has the longest lake coastline in the world: about 5250 km, excluding the coastline of its many inner islands. Even if it is considered two lakes, Lake Huron alone would still have the longest coastline in the world at 2980 km.\n * The largest island in a lake is Manitoulin Island in Lake Michigan-Huron, with a surface area of 2766 km². Lake Manitou, on Manitoulin Island, is the largest lake on an island in a lake.\n * The largest lake on an island is Nettilling Lake on Baffin Island, with an area of 5542 km² and a maximum length of 123 km.\n * The largest lake in the world that drains naturally in two directions is Wollaston Lake.\n * Lake Toba on the island of Sumatra is in what is probably the largest resurgent caldera on Earth.\n * The largest lake completely within the boundaries of a single city is Lake Wanapitei in the city of Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Before the current city boundaries came into effect in 2001, this status was held by Lake Ramsey, also in Sudbury.\n * Lake Enriquillo in Dominican Republic is the only saltwater lake in the world inhabited by crocodiles.\n * Lake Bernard, Ontario, Canada, claims to be the largest lake in the world with no islands.\n * The largest lake in one country is Lake Michigan, in the United States. However, it is sometimes considered part of Lake Michigan-Huron, making the record go to Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, in Canada, the largest lake within one jurisdiction.\n * The largest lake on an island in a lake on an island is Crater Lake on Vulcano Island in Lake Taal on the island of Luzon, The Philippines.\n * The northernmost named lake on Earth is Upper Dumbell Lake in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada at a latitude of 82°28'N. It is 5.2 km southwest of Alert, the northernmost settlement in the world. There are also several small lakes north of Upper Dumbell Lake, but they are all unnamed and only appear on very detailed maps.\n\nThe largest lakes (surface area) by continent are:\n * Australia – Lake Eyre (salt lake)\n * Africa – Lake Victoria, also the third-largest freshwater lake on Earth. It is one of the Great Lakes of Africa.\n * Antarctica – Lake Vostok (subglacial)\n * Asia – Lake Baikal (if the Caspian Sea is considered a lake, it is the largest in Eurasia, but is divided between the two geographic continents)\n * Oceania – Lake Eyre when filled; the largest permanent (and freshwater) lake in Oceania is Lake Taupo.\n * Europe – Lake Ladoga, followed by Lake Onega, both in northwestern Russia.\n * North America – Lake Michigan-Huron, which is hydrologically a single lake. However, lakes Huron and Michigan are usually considered separate lakes, in which case Lake Superior would be the largest.\n * South America – Lake Titicaca, which is also the highest navigable body of water on Earth at 3812 m above sea level.

      "title": "Lake Manchar",
      "description": "\n\nLake Manchar (منڇر ڍنڍ ) is the largest freshwater lake in Pakistan and one of Asia's largest. It is located west of the Indus River, in Jamshoro District and Dadu District, Sindh. It is located at a distance of 18 km from Sehwan Sharif on west side of the River Indus, in district Jamshoro. before creation of Jamshoro District it was in Dadu District. Jamshoro district was split from Dadu District in December 2004. Manchar is a beautiful shallow lake located in district Jamshoro, Sindh. The area of the lake fluctuates with the seasons from as little as 350 km² to as much as 520 km². The lake collects water from numerous small streams in the Kirthar Mountains and empties into the Indus River.\n\nManchar Lake is very ancient. The ancient archaeological sites Ghazi Shah, Wahi Pandhi Ali Murad Mound and other were located along its banks or nearby Lake Manchar which are evident regarding its ancientness. The sites of Lal Chatto, Mashak Lohri and Lakhiyo situated along the edge of  lake Manchar are most ancient sites which enlightens the oldness of the lake. The mentioned sites belong to Hrappan Culture. The lake appeared in the result of big branch of Indus River flowing from Kashmore, Kandhkot and Jacobabad to Manchar Lake. Later, that branch became silted and Nara canal was created to water the lake in the 1930s when the Sukkur Barrage was constructed on the river Indus. The lake is fed by two canals, the Aral and the Danister from the river Indus. Until recently the lake supported thousands of fisherfolk, near village Kot Lashari Bobak railway station, who depended on the freshwater fish they caught in the lake. However, the lake is now undergoing environmental degradation resulting in the water becoming saline and killing off the fish and forcing the fisherfolk to look elsewhere for employment.\n\nThe degradation has been occurring for a long time but only recently have the effects been felt. The diversion of water from the Indus and a diminished storm runoff from the Kirthar mountains have contributed to the reduction in fresh water supplies. At the same time, saline drainage water from agricultural fields of Balochistan and surrounding areas has started to flow into Lake Manchar. However between 10 August and 23 August 2009, 700 cuft/s of water was introduced in the lake via Indus River.\n\nThe lake was a stop-off on the Indus flyway for Siberian migratory birds, but recently the numbers have fallen from 25,000 birds counted in 1988 to just 2,800 bird counted in 2002, because the lake no longer provides the birds' main food, the lake fish. In the place of the birds, the lake now hosts a saline water reed.\n\nThe lake also provided large volumes of water for irrigation but this has also been reduced and has resulted in a great reduction in the area irrigated by the lake. Right Bank Outfall Drain is being built to save lake from contamination.\n\nLake Manchar is populated by the Mohana tribe.\n\n\n * Environmental degradation\n * Indus River\n\n*",

It is 6.58 km2 in size and is surrounded by marshes and brackish seepage lagoons.\n\nHaleji Lake was a saline lagoon until the 1930s and was converted into a reservoir to provide additional water to Karachi. During World War II, additional water was required for troops stationed at Karachi. The then-British Government of Sindh Province decided to increase the capacity of the lake by introducing a feeder canal from the Indus River. Salt water was drained out and an embankment was constructed around the lake which was fed with fresh water through a canal. The work was placed on a war footing and was completed within 24 months.\n\nHaleji Lake is a wintering site for waterfowl such as cotton teal, spot-billed duck, purple moorhen and pheasant-tailed jacana.
